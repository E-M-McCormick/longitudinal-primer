TITLE:
 Chapter 2: Canonical Latent Curve Model (LCM)
DATA:
 FILE = 02-executive-function.dat;
VARIABLE:
 NAMES = id dlpfc1-dlpfc4; 
 USEVARIABLES = dlpfc1-dlpfc4;
 MISSING = .;
ANALYSIS:
 ESTIMATOR = ML;
MODEL:
 ! Define the Latent Variables (the | is a shortcut the usual BY syntax)
 int slp | dlpfc1@0 dlpfc2@1 dlpfc3@2 dlpfc4@3;
 
 ! Define Factor Means
 [int slp];
 
 ! Define Factor (Co)Variances
 int slp;
 int WITH slp;
 
 ! Define Indicator Residual Variances
 dlpfc1-dlpfc4;
 
OUTPUT:
 STDYX;
