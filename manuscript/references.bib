	abstract = {This book offers readers an understanding of longitudinal structural equation modeling that is simultaneously accessible, broad, and deep. The 10 chapters of the book guide readers from a basic understanding of latent variable modeling, through state-of-the-science longitudinal models. Whether you are a beginner or seasoned researcher, this book will expand your data analytic skill set. The first four chapters provide a foundation for subsequent longitudinal modeling. Chapter 1 offers a review of latent variable modeling, and Chapter 2 offers an introduction to design considerations for longitudinal studies. Chapters 3 and 4 further review foundational latent variable principles. Although the material described in these chapters overlaps with that of more general structural equation modeling texts, there are many unique gems of knowledge within these chapters. Chapter 1 includes a careful consideration of parceling, Chapter 2 offers an insightful discussion of timing of measurement in longitudinal studies, Chapter 3 attends to the oft-neglected topic of scaling latent variables, and Chapter 4 provokes deeper conceptual thinking about model fit than is typically offered. I anticipate that all readers will learn a considerable amount even in these foundational chapters. The remaining six chapters of this book describe the key analytic models for longitudinal data. Rather than just presenting one favorite model, as do many books, this book offers a balanced approach to describing different types of models, in Chapters 5 (longitudinal {CFA}), 6 (panel models), Chapter 7 (P-technique for time series), and 8 (growth curve models). Along the way, Todd thoroughly covers issues of multigroup analysis, moderation, mediation, and more complex models, e.g., multitrait multimethod, bifactor). The coverage within these chapters strikes a remarkable balance between big-picture ideas and details, between conceptual understanding and data analysis examples, and between accessibility and necessary technical aspects of longitudinal modeling. Todd gives a balanced presentation of the advantages and challenges of each of these models. This will allow you to choose the model that best answers your research question, rather than adapting your research question to one model and force-fitting it into one analytic framework. A general theme throughout this book is to help you make informed choices regarding your analyses. Todd teaches you how to choose the most useful of a wide range of data analytic tools, and then to use them well. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Change is constant in everyday life. Infants crawl and then walk, children learn to read and write, teenagers mature in myriad ways, the elderly become frail and forgetful. Beyond these natural processes and events, external forces and interventions instigate and disrupt change: test scores may rise after a coaching course, drug abusers may remain abstinent after residential treatment. By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis is a much-needed professional book for empirical researchers and graduate students in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. It offers the first accessible in-depth presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using clear, concise prose and real data sets from published studies, the authors take you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis offers readers a private consultation session with internationally recognized experts and represents a unique contribution to the literature on quantitative empirical methods.Visit http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/examples/alda.htm for:{DT} Downloadable data {setsDT} Library of computer programs in {SAS}, {SPSS}, Stata, {HLM}, {MLwiN}, and {moreDT} Additional material for data analysis},

	abstract = {In psychological science, researchers often pay particular attention to the distinction between within- and between-person relationships in longitudinal data analysis. Here, we aim to clarify the relationship between the within- and between-person distinction and causal inference, and show that the distinction is informative but does not play a decisive role for causal inference. Our main points are threefold. First, within-person data are not necessary for causal inference; for example, between-person experiments can inform us about (average) causal effects. Second, within-person data are not sufficient for causal inference; for example, time-varying confounders can lead to spurious within-person associations. Finally, despite not being sufficient, within-person data can be tremendously helpful for causal inference. We provide pointers to help readers navigate the more technical literature on longitudinal models, and conclude with a call for more conceptual clarity: Instead of letting statistical models dictate which substantive questions we ask, we should start with well-defined theoretical estimands which in turn determine both study design and data analysis.},

	abstract = {Many emerging studies investigating individual differences in developmental change include only two time points of data collection. We offer conceptual and empirical arguments that this approach will often fail to meet the stated goal. First and foremost, analyzing data when subsequent waves are planned is analogous to “peeking” at data with half the sample collected. Practical concerns of funding and pressure to publish might counterbalance these downsides if analyses of early waves are good indicators of full developmental trajectories. We demonstrate empirically that this is unlikely to be the case, because of the imprecision of two time point change models to characterize underlying trajectories of change. Even under ideal simulated conditions (i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio, known functional form), two time points are not sufficient to accurately cap-ture individual differences in trajectories of change. We generated underlying longitudinal data and fit models with 2, 3, 4, and 5 time points across 1000 samples. Recovery was poor for the two time point model, correlating typically at r = 0.41 with the true individual parameters – meaning that these scores share only 16.8\% of variance – and even lower reliability ({ICC}(2) = 0.28). As expected, models with more time points recovered the growth parameter more accurately. Yet, parameter recovery for the three time point model was still low, correlating typically around r = 0.57 ({ICC}(2) = 0.51). We argue that preliminary analyses on early subsets of time points in longitudinal analyses is detrimental to the ultimate goals of studies of change over time.},

However, little research has examined whether {EB} estimates are indeed reliable and valid measures of individual traits. In this article, we use statistical theory and simulated data to show that {EB} estimates are biased toward zero, a phenomenon known as “shrinkage.” The degree of shrinkage and reliability of {EB} estimates depend on a number of factors, including Level-1 residual variance, Level-1 predictor variance, Level-2 random effects variance, and number of within-person observations. As a result, {EB} estimates may not be ideal for detecting outliers, and they produce biased regression coefficients when used as predictors. We illustrate these issues using an empirical data set on emotion regulation and neuroticism.},

	abstract = {Diverse analysis approaches have been proposed to distinguish data missing due to death from nonresponse, and to summarize trajectories of longitudinal data truncated by death. We demonstrate how these analysis approaches arise from factorizations of the distribution of longitudinal data and survival information. Models are illustrated using cognitive functioning data for older adults. For unconditional models, deaths do not occur, deaths are independent of the longitudinal response, or the unconditional longitudinal response is averaged over the survival distribution. Unconditional models, such as random effects models fit to unbalanced data, may implicitly impute data beyond the time of death. Fully conditional models stratify the longitudinal response trajectory by time of death. Fully conditional models are effective for describing individual trajectories, in terms of either aging (age, or years from baseline) or dying (years from death). Causal models (principal stratification) as currently applied are fully conditional models, since group differences at one timepoint are described for a cohort that will survive past a later timepoint. Partly conditional models summarize the longitudinal response in the dynamic cohort of survivors. Partly conditional models are serial cross-sectional snapshots of the response, reflecting the average response in survivors at a given timepoint rather than individual trajectories. Joint models of survival and longitudinal response describe the evolving health status of the entire cohort. Researchers using longitudinal data should consider which method of accommodating deaths is consistent with research aims, and use analysis methods accordingly.},

	abstract = {Methodological innovations have allowed researchers to consider increasingly sophisticated statistical models that are better in line with the complexities of real-world behavioral data. However, despite these powerful new analytic approaches, sample sizes may not always be sufficiently large to deal with the increase in model complexity. This difficult modeling scenario entails large models with a limited number of observations given the number of parameters. Here, we describe a particular strategy to overcome this challenge: regularization, a method of penalizing model complexity during estimation. Regularization has proven to be a viable option for estimating parameters in this small-sample, many-predictors setting, but so far it has been used mostly in linear regression models. We show how to integrate regularization within structural equation models, a popular analytic approach in psychology. We first describe the rationale behind regularization in regression contexts and how it can be extended to regularized structural equation modeling. We then evaluate our approach using a simulation study, showing that regularized structural equation modeling outperforms traditional structural equation modeling in situations with a large number of predictors and a small sample size. Next, we illustrate the power of this approach in two empirical examples: modeling the neural determinants of visual short-term memory and identifying demographic correlates of stress, anxiety, and depression.},

In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models η( x) = β' x, where η( x) = g(μ( x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions f$_{\textrm{j}}$(x$_{\textrm{j}}$) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals.},

With multiple indicators, tests of factorial invariance of parameters across times of measurement can be tested. We conduct such tests using two sets of data, which differ in the extent to which factorial invariance holds, and evaluate longitudinal confirmatory factor, latent growth curve, and latent difference score models. We demonstrate that, if factorial invariance fails to hold, choice of indicator used to identify the latent variable can have substantial influences on the characterization of patterns of growth, strong enough to alter conclusions about growth.

The measurement of time plays a critical role because the explanatory variables multiplicatively interact with time in the prediction of the repeated measures. However, this interaction is not typically capitalized on in {LCA} because the measure of time is rather subtly incorporated via the factor loading matrix. The authors' goal is to demonstrate both analytically and empirically that classic techniques for probing interactions in multiple regression can be generalized to {LCA}. A worked example is presented, and the use of these techniques is recommended whenever estimating conditional {LCAs} in practice. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Within the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, there is an increasing interest in studying individual differences in human brain development in order to predict mental health outcomes. So far, however, most longitudinal neuroimaging studies focus on group-level estimates. In this review, we highlight longitudinal neuroimaging studies that have moved beyond group-level estimates to illustrate the heterogeneity in patterns of brain development. We provide practical methodological recommendations on how longitudinal neuroimaging datasets can be used to understand heterogeneity in human brain development. Finally, we address how taking an individual-differences approach in developmental neuroimaging studies could advance our understanding of why some individuals develop mental health disorders.},

	title = {A more general model for testing measurement invariance and differential item functioning},
	volume = {22},
	abstract = {The evaluation of measurement invariance is an important step in establishing the validity and comparability of measurements across individuals. Most commonly, measurement invariance has been examined using 1 of 2 primary latent variable modeling approaches: the multiple groups model or the multiple-indicator multiple-cause ({MIMIC}) model. Both approaches offer opportunities to detect differential item functioning within multi-item scales, and thereby to test measurement invariance, but both approaches also have significant limitations. The multiple groups model allows 1 to examine the invariance of all model parameters but only across levels of a single categorical individual difference variable (e.g., ethnicity). In contrast, the {MIMIC} model permits both categorical and continuous individual difference variables (e.g., sex and age) but permits only a subset of the model parameters to vary as a function of these characteristics. The current article argues that moderated nonlinear factor analysis ({MNLFA}) constitutes an alternative, more flexible model for evaluating measurement invariance and differential item functioning. We show that the {MNLFA} subsumes and combines the strengths of the multiple group and {MIMIC} models, allowing for a full and simultaneous assessment of measurement invariance and differential item functioning across multiple categorical and/or continuous individual difference variables. The relationships between the {MNLFA} model and the multiple groups and {MIMIC} models are shown mathematically and via an empirical demonstration. ({PsycINFO} Database Record},

	title = {Controlling for cohort effects in accelerated longitudinal designs using continuous- and discrete-time dynamic models},
	url = {https://osf.io/gxb6p},
	abstract = {Accelerated longitudinal designs ({ALDs}) allow examining developmental changes over a period of time longer than the duration of the study. In {ALDs}, participants enter the study at different ages (i.e., different cohorts), and provide measures during a time frame shorter than the total study. They key assumption is that participants from the different cohorts come from the same population and, therefore, can be assumed to share the same general trajectory. The consequences of not meeting that assumption have not been examined systematically. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect and control for cohort differences in {ALDs} using Latent Change Score models in both discrete and continuous time. We evaluated the effectiveness of such a method through a Monte Carlo study. Our results indicate that, in a broad set of empirically relevant conditions, both {LCS} specifications can adequately estimate cohort effects ranging from very small to very large, with slightly better performance of the continuous-time version. Across all conditions, cohort effects on the asymptotic level ({dAs}) caused much larger bias than on the latent initial level (d0). When cohort differences were present, including them in the model led to unbiased estimates. In contrast, not including them led to tenable results only when such differences were not large (d0 ≤ 1 and {dAs} ≤ 0.2). Among the sampling schedules evaluated, those including at least three measurements per participant over 4 years or more led to the best performance. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations regarding study designs and data analysis.},

This article introduces a statistical technique for analyzing {SCD} data that has not been much used in psychological and educational research: generalized additive models ({GAMs}). In parametric regression, the researcher must choose a functional form to impose on the data, for example, that trend over time is linear. {GAMs} reverse this process by letting the data inform the choice of functional form. In this article we review the problem that trend poses in {SCDs}, discuss how current {SCD} analytic methods approach trend, describe {GAMs} as a possible solution, suggest a {GAM} model testing procedure for examining the presence of trend in {SCDs}, present a small simulation to show the statistical properties of {GAMs}, and illustrate the procedure on 3 examples of different lengths. Results suggest that {GAMs} may be very useful both as a form of sensitivity analysis for checking the plausibility of assumptions about trend and as a primary data analysis strategy for testing treatment effects. We conclude with a discussion of some problems with {GAMs} and some future directions for research on the application of {GAMs} to {SCDs}.

In this longitudinal {fMRI} study (736 scans spanning 5 years in participants ages 8–29), we investigate whether adolescents show enhanced striatal activity during feedback learning, and whether this enhanced activity is associated with better learning performance. Here we report that neural activity indicating sensitivity to informative value of feedback peaks in late adolescence and occurs in dorsal caudate, ventral caudate, and nucleus accumbens. Increased activity in dorsal and ventral caudate predicts better current and future learning performance. This suggests that enhanced striatal activity in adolescents is adaptive for learning and may point to adolescence as a unique life phase for increased feedback-learning performance.},

	abstract = {The effects of aging on myelinated nerve fibers of the central nervous system are complex. Many myelinated nerve fibers in white matter degenerate and are lost, leading to some disconnections between various parts of the central nervous system. Other myelinated nerve fibers are affected differently, because only their sheaths degenerate, leaving the axons intact. Such axons are remyelinated by a series of internodes that are much shorter than the original ones and are composed of thinner sheaths. Thus the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, the oligodendrocytes, remain active during aging. Indeed, not only do these neuroglial cell remyelinate axons, with age they also continue to add lamellae to the myelin sheaths of intact nerve fibers, so that sheaths become thicker. It is presumed that the degeneration of myelin sheaths is due to the degeneration of the parent oligodendrocyte, and that the production of increased numbers of internodes as a consequence of remyelination requires additional oligodendrocytes. Whether there is a turnover of oligodendrocytes during life has not been studied in primates, but it has been established that over the life span of the monkey, there is a substantial increase in the numbers of oligodendrocytes. While the loss of some myelinated nerve fibers leads to some disconnections, the degeneration of other myelin sheaths and the subsequent remyelination of axons by shorter internodes slow down the rate conduction along nerve fibers. These changes affect the integrity and timing in neuronal circuits, and there is evidence that they contribute to cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {Model fit assessment is a central component of evaluating confirmatory factor analysis models and the validity of psychological assessments. Fit indices remain popular and researchers often judge fit with fixed cutoffs derived by Hu and Bentler (1999). Despite their overwhelming popularity, methodological studies have cautioned against fixed cutoffs, noting that the meaning of fit indices varies based on a complex interaction of model characteristics like factor reliability, number of items, and number of factors. Criticism of fixed cutoffs stems primarily from the fact that they were derived from one specific confirmatory factor analysis model and lack generalizability. To address this, we propose a simulation-based method called dynamic fit index cutoffs such that derivation of cutoffs is adaptively tailored to the specific model and data characteristics being evaluated. Unlike previously proposed simulation-based techniques, our method removes existing barriers to implementation by providing an open-source, Web based Shiny software application that automates the entire process so that users neither need to manually write any software code nor be knowledgeable about foundations of Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, we extend fit index cutoff derivations to include sets of cutoffs for multiple levels of misspecification. In doing so, fit indices can more closely resemble their originally intended purpose as effect sizes quantifying misfit rather than improperly functioning as ad hoc hypothesis tests. We also provide an approach specifically designed for the nuances of 1-factor models, which have received surprisingly little attention in the literature despite frequent substantive interests in unidimensionality.

Although other methods exist and are widely implemented in other disciplines, it seems that psychologists have yet to consider these methods in substantive studies. This article compares and contrasts {HLM} with alternative methods including generalized estimating equations and cluster-robust standard errors. These alternative methods do not model random effects and thus make a smaller number of assumptions and are interpreted identically to single-level methods with the benefit that estimates are adjusted to reflect clustering of observations. Situations where these alternative methods may be advantageous are discussed including research questions where random effects are and are not required, when random effects can change the interpretation of regression coefficients, challenges of modeling with random effects with discrete outcomes, and examples of published psychology articles that use {HLM} that may have benefitted from using alternative methods. Illustrative examples are provided and discussed to demonstrate the advantages of the alternative methods and also when {HLM} would be the preferred method.

	abstract = {Time-varying covariates ({TVCs}) are a common component of growth models. Though mixed effect models ({MEMs}) and latent curve models ({LCMs}) are often seen as interchangeable, {LCMs} are generally more flexible for accommodating {TVCs}. Specifically, the standard {MEM} constrains the effect of {TVCs} across time-points whereas the typical {LCM} specification can estimate time-specific {TVC} effects, can include lagged {TVC} effects, or constrain some {TVC} effects based on theoretically appropriate phases. However, when data are time-unstructured, {LCMs} can have difficulty providing {TVC} effects whose interpretation aligns with typical research questions. This paper shows how {MEMs} can be adapted to yield {TVC} effects that mirror the flexibility of {LCMs} such that the model likelihoods are identical in ideal circumstances. We then extend this adaptation to the context of time-unstructured data where {MEMs} tend to be more flexible than {LCMs}.

	abstract = {Clustered data are common in many fields. Some prominent examples of clustering are employees clustered within supervisors, students within classrooms, and clients within therapists. Many methods exist that explicitly consider the dependency introduced by a clustered data structure, but the multitude of available options has resulted in rigid disciplinary preferences. For example, those working in the psychological, organizational behavior, medical, and educational fields generally prefer mixed effects models, whereas those working in economics, behavioral finance, and strategic management generally prefer fixed effects models. However, increasingly interdisciplinary research has caused lines that separate the fields grounded in psychology and those grounded in economics to blur, leading to researchers encountering unfamiliar statistical methods commonly found in other disciplines. Persistent discipline-specific preferences can be particularly problematic because (a) each approach has certain limitations that can restrict the types of research questions that can be appropriately addressed, and (b) analyses based on the statistical modeling decisions common in one discipline can be difficult to understand for researchers trained in alternative disciplines. This can impede cross-disciplinary collaboration and limit the ability of scientists to make appropriate use of research from adjacent fields. This article discusses the differences between mixed effects and fixed effects models for clustered data, reviews each approach, and helps to identify when each approach is optimal. We then discuss the within–between specification, which blends advantageous properties of each framework into a single model. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

However, models for longitudinal tests have not considered opportunities to estimate new quantities that are unavailable from single-administration tests. Specifically, we discuss dynamic measurement models – which combine aspects of longitudinal {IRT}, nonlinear growth models, and dynamic assessment – to directly estimate capacity, defined as the expected future score once the construct has fully developed. After discussing the history and connecting these areas into a single framework, we apply the model to verbal test scores from the Intergenerational Studies, which follow 494 people from 3 to 72 years old. The goal is to predict adult verbal scores (Age ≥ 34) from adolescent scores (Age ≤ 20). We held-out the adult data for prediction and compared predictions from traditional longitudinal {IRT} ability scores and proposed dynamic measurement capacity scores from models fit to the adolescent data. Results showed that the R2 from capacity scores were 2.5 times larger than the R2 from longitudinal {IRT} ability scores (43\% vs. 16\%), providing some evidence that exploring new quantities available from longitudinal testing could be worthwhile when an interest in testing is forecasting future performance.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in the timing of developmental processes are often of interest in longitudinal studies, yet common statistical approaches to modeling change cannot directly estimate the timing of when change occurs. The time-to-criterion framework was recently developed to incorporate the timing of a prespecified criterion value; however, this framework has difficulty accommodating contexts where the criterion value differs across people or when the criterion value is not known a priori, such as when the interest is in individual differences in when change starts or stops. This article combines aspects of reparameterized quadratic models and multiphase models to provide information on the timing of change. We first consider the more common situation of modeling decelerating change to an offset point, defined as the point in time at which change ceases. For increasing trajectories, the offset occurs when the criterion attains its maximum ('inverted J-shaped' trajectories). For decreasing trajectories, offset instead occurs at the minimum. Our model allows for individual differences in both the timing of offset and ultimate level of the outcome. The same model, reparameterized slightly, captures accelerating change from a point of onset ('J-shaped' trajectories). We then extend the framework to accommodate 'S-shaped' curves where both the onset and offset of change are within the observation window. We provide demonstrations that span neuroscience, educational psychology, developmental psychology, and cognitive science, illustrating the applicability of the modeling framework to a variety of research questions about individual differences in the timing of change.

The initial structural equation modeling ({SEM}) path model isolated several training effects and an important source of transfer of training, Near→Far, but this transfer was not increased due to training. The subsequent models, which accounted for pretest differences and latent changes, implied that only the Near measurements were influenced by training, and the change transfer was small. Introduction of common factors for both Near and Far measurements showed the factor patterns were unaffected by training or time and suggested training was a broader effect than in any single variable. The bivariate analysis of common factors did not appear to alter the previous results. Addition of demographic covariates and latent mixture analysis of the trained group led to further results. The uses of contemporary {SEMs} with experimental data are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

The present study uses longitudinal data on 7,640 youth from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth Children and Young Adults, a nationally representative sample assessed biennially from 1994 to 2006. Latent growth curve models were used to investigate mean age-related changes in self-reports of impulsivity and sensation seeking from ages 12 to 24 years, as well individual differences in these changes. Three novel findings are reported. First, impulsivity and sensation seeking showed diverging patterns of longitudinal change at the population level. Second, there was substantial person-to-person variation in the magnitudes of developmental change in both impulsivity and sensation seeking, with some teenagers showing rapid changes as they matured and others maintaining relatively constant levels with age. Finally, the correlation between age-related changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking was modest and not significant. Together, these results constitute the first support for the dual systems model of adolescent development to derive from longitudinal behavioral data.

The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the {CLPM} fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the {CLPM} do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the {CLPM} and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the {CLPM} to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.

The age-related effects were similar across variables, but the practice effects were largest for memory and smallest for speed. When retest effects were not included in the models, the age-related effects were underestimated, with the magnitude of bias depending on the size of the ignored retest effects.

A number of alternatives have been offered, most of which require the investigator to have strong, theoretically guided hypotheses and presume that the data conform strictly to the demands of the design. This article addresses the common situation in which data analysis is exploratory rather than hypothesis testing and in which the model is applied to data that only loosely meet the requirements of the design. In this case, aging, period, or cohort effects can be inferred if the researcher is willing to make appropriate restrictive assumptions and use scientific judgment rather than fixed decision rules. The application of judgmental principles is illustrated on 2 longitudinal data sets, and it is argued that the analytic designs are useful if intelligently applied and interpreted.

	abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric {TV}-{AR} model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the {TV}-{AR} model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the {TV}-{AR} model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Assessing overall fit is a topic of keen interest to structural equation modelers, yet measuring goodness of fit has been hampered by several factors. First, the assumptions that underlie the chi-square tests of model fit often are violated. Second, many fit measures (e.g., Bentler and Bonett's [1980] normed fit index) have unknown statistical distributions so that hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, or comparisons of significant differences in these fit indices are not possible. Finally, modelers have little knowledge about the distribution and behavior of the fit measures for misspecified models or for nonnested models. Given this situation, bootstrapping techniques would appear to be an ideal means to tackle these problems. Indeed, Bentler's (1989) {EQS} 3.0 and Jöreskog and Sörbom's (forthcoming) {LISREL} 8 have bootstrap resampling options to bootstrap fit indices. In this article the authors (a) demonstrate that the usual bootstrapping methods will fail when applied to the original data, (b) explain why this occurs, and, (c) propose a modified bootstrap method for the chi-square test statistic for model fit. They include simulated and empirical examples to illustrate their results.},

These 3 dimensions changed significantly during this period, with parental negativity increasing more rapidly after age 12.

	abstract = {Summary. I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in the behavioral sciences, with key advantages including increased power, more comprehensive measurement, and establishment of temporal precedence. One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a time-varying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.},

	abstract = {Over the past three decades, considerable effort has been dedicated to quantifying the pace of ageing yet identifying the most essential metrics of ageing remains challenging due to lack of comprehensive measurements and heterogeneity of the ageing processes. Most of the previously proposed metrics of ageing have been emerged from cross-sectional associations with chronological age and predictive accuracy of mortality, thus lacking a conceptual model of functional or phenotypic domains. Further, such models may be biased by selective attrition and are unable to address underlying biological constructs contributing to functional markers of age-related decline. Using longitudinal data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging ({BLSA}), we propose a conceptual framework to identify metrics of ageing that may capture the hierarchical and temporal relationships between functional ageing, phenotypic ageing and biological ageing based on four hypothesized domains: body composition, energy regulation, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity. We explored the longitudinal trajectories of key variables within these phenotypes using linear mixed-effects models and more than 10 years of data. Understanding the longitudinal trajectories across these domains in the {BLSA} provides a reference for researchers, informs future refinement of the phenotypic ageing framework and establishes a solid foundation for future models of biological ageing.},

	abstract = {Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with significant maternal and foetal morbidity. Measurement of blood pressure remains the standard way of identifying individuals at risk. There is growing interest in the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitors ({ABPM}), which can record an individual's blood pressure many times over a 24-hour period. From a clinical perspective interest lies in the shape of the blood pressure profile over a 24-hour period and any differences in the profile between groups. We propose a two-level hierarchical linear model incorporating all {ABPM} data into a single model. We contrast a classical approach with a Bayesian approach using the results of a study of 206 pregnant women who were asked to wear an {ABPM} for 24 hours after referral to an obstetric day unit with high blood pressure. As the main interest lies in the shape of the profile, we use restricted cubic splines to model the mean profiles. The use of restricted cubic splines provides a flexible way to model the mean profiles and to make comparisons between groups. From examining the data and the fit of the model it is apparent that there were heterogeneous within-subject variances in that some women tend to have more variable blood pressure than others. Within the Bayesian framework it is relatively easy to incorporate a random effect to model the between-subject variation in the within-subject variances. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in the within-subject variances, allowing for this in the model has surprisingly little impact on the estimates of the mean profiles or their confidence/credible intervals. We thus demonstrate a powerful method for analysis of {ABPM} data and also demonstrate how heterogeneous within-subject variances can be modelled from a Bayesian perspective.

A major problem with using piecewise models is determining the precise location of the point where the change in the process has occurred and uncovering the related number of segments. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an optimization procedure that can be used to determine both the segments and location of the knots in piecewise linear latent growth models. The procedure is illustrated using empirical data in order to detect the number of segments and change points.

In terms of the definition and parameters of the model, limits are determined in which the types of suppression can occur.

Previous research on the impact of political violence on prosocial behaviors in mixed, finding both positive and negative links. This study examines this relation using a launch and ambient approach, which helps to disentangle these effects over time. To do so, the article prospectively examines trajectories of adolescent prosocial behaviors (N = 999; Time 1: Mage = 12.18 years, {SD} = 1.82, range = 10–20) over 6 consecutive years in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a setting of on-going sectarian conflict. A dual change model, which combines the strengths of auto-regressive and latent growth curves approaches, found an initial shallow decrease in prosocial behaviors that dropped more sharply in later adolescence. Exposure to sectarianism related to an accelerated decrease in prosocial behaviors. Trajectories of prosocial behaviors positively related to later social and political engagement. Intervention implications address how to promote youth prosocial behaviors and civic engagement amid protracted political conflict. This type of research is needed because participation in civic life is a good indicator of youth agency and has positive implications for society.

Self-report questionnaires provided data at pretest (Ns=238, 221, and 208 for the Iowa Strengthening Families Program [{ISFP}], Preparing for the Drug Free Years [{PDFY}], and control groups, respectively), with seven data points through young adulthood (age 21). In latent growth modeling, three young adult {HRSB} measures (number of sexual partners, condom use, substance use with sex) and lifetime {STDs} were specified as distal outcomes mediated by adolescent substance initiation growth factors (average level and rate of change). Results showed that the models fit the data and, except for condom use, there were significant indirect effects, with a higher frequency of significant findings for {ISFP}. The model additions of direct intervention effects on young adult outcomes generally were not supported, consistent with a model positing that long-term intervention effects on young adult {HRSBs} and {STDs} outcomes are indirect. As an indication of the practical significance of long-term effects, analyses revealed relative reduction rates ranging from 6 \% to 46 \% for significant outcomes.},

	abstract = {Statistical mediation analysis can help to identify and explain the mechanisms behind psychological processes. Examining a set of variables for mediation effects is a ubiquitous process in the social sciences literature; however, despite evidence suggesting that cross-sectional data can misrepresent the mediation of longitudinal processes, cross-sectional analyses continue to be used in this manner. Alternative longitudinal mediation models, including those rooted in a structural equation modeling framework (cross-lagged panel, latent growth curve, and latent difference score models) are currently available and may provide a better representation of mediation processes for longitudinal data. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, we provide a comparison of cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models; second, we advocate using models to evaluate mediation effects that capture the temporal sequence of the process under study. Two separate empirical examples are presented to illustrate differences in the conclusions drawn from cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation analyses. Findings from these examples yielded substantial differences in interpretations between the cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models considered here. Based on these observations, researchers should use caution when attempting to use cross-sectional data in place of longitudinal data for mediation analyses.},

This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4–16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule – distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how violence exposure (e.g. child maltreatment, witnessing community violence) influence both externalizing and Post-Traumatic Stress ({PTS}) symptoms among children in foster care. Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) ({NSCAW}; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and {PTS} symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services ({CPS}) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist ({CBCL}) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children ({TSCC}) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n=280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and {PTS} symptomatology were both significantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the first two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and {PTS} symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of {PTS} on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between {PTS} and externalizing symptoms and the effect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.},

	abstract = {Clinical scientists can use a continuum of registration efforts that vary in their disclosure and timing relative to data collection and analysis. Broadly speaking, registration benefits investigators by offering stronger, more powerful tests of theory with particular methods in tandem with better control of long-run false positive error rates. Registration helps clinical researchers in thinking through tensions between bandwidth and fidelity that surround recruiting participants, defining clinical phenotypes, handling comorbidity, treating missing data, and analyzing rich and complex data. In particular, registration helps record and justify the reasons behind specific study design decisions, though it also provides the opportunity to register entire decision trees with specific endpoints. Creating ever more faithful registrations and standard operating procedures may offer alternative methods of judging a clinical investigator’s scientific skill and eminence because study registration increases the transparency of clinical researchers’ work., General Scientific Summary: Study registration allows clinical scientists to make their work more credible and transparent to fellow researchers and the general public. We describe the dimensions of disclosure and timing relative to data collection and analysis on which researchers can register their study designs, how registration makes for better science, and the kinds of issues for which registration is particularly helpful in clinical research. We also show how registration permits researchers to flexibly register specific individual decisions or complex decision trees to deal with potential problems in a study.},

	abstract = {Previous studies provided mixed findings on pecularities in p-value distributions in psychology. This paper examined 258,050 test results across 30,710 articles from eight high impact journals to investigate the existence of a peculiar prevalence of p-values just below .05 (i.e., a bump) in the psychological literature, and a potential increase thereof over time. We indeed found evidence for a bump just below .05 in the distribution of exactly reported p-values in the journals Developmental Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, but the bump did not increase over the years and disappeared when using recalculated p-values. We found clear and direct evidence for the {QRP} “incorrect rounding of p-value” (John, Loewenstein \& Prelec, 2012) in all psychology journals. Finally, we also investigated monotonic excess of p-values, an effect of certain {QRPs} that has been neglected in previous research, and developed two measures to detect this by modeling the distributions of statistically significant p-values. Using simulations and applying the two measures to the retrieved test results, we argue that, although one of the measures suggests the use of {QRPs} in psychology, it is difficult to draw general conclusions concerning {QRPs} based on modeling of p-value distributions.},

In reality there is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations. The sample size needed for a study depends on many factors, including the size of the model, distribution of the variables, amount of missing data, reliability of the variables, and strength of the relations among the variables. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how substantive researchers can use a Monte Carlo study to decide on sample size and determine power. Two models are used as examples, a confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) model and a growth model. The analyses are carried out using the Mplus program (Muthén\& Muthén 1998).},

In this review, we discuss the opportunities that these efforts offer for the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, in particular developmental neuroimaging. We focus on issues broadly related to statistical power and to flexibility and transparency in data analyses. Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, lifespan modelling, analyses of longitudinal changes, and data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental neuroimaging, and how preregistration can improve methodological rigor. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is ever-growing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.},

This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum p value within the initial sample such that the dataset would be augmented. With one round of augmentation, Type I error inflation maximizes at .0975 with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical value to allow augmentation while maintaining p {\textless} .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, paugmented, that represents the magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation. We argue that the disclosure of post-hoc dataset augmentation via paugmented elevates such augmentation from a questionable research practice to an ethical research decision.},

              The main objective of “Lifebrain” is to identify the determinants of brain, cognitive and mental ({BCM}) health at different stages of life. By integrating, harmonising and enriching major European neuroimaging studies across the life span, we will merge fine-grained {BCM} health measures of more than 5000 individuals. Longitudinal brain imaging, genetic and health data are available for a major part, as well as cognitive and mental health measures for the broader cohorts, exceeding 27,000 examinations in total. By linking these data to other databases and biobanks, including birth registries, national and regional archives, and by enriching them with a new online data collection and novel measures, we will address the risk factors and protective factors of {BCM} health. We will identify pathways through which risk and protective factors work and their moderators. Exploiting existing European infrastructures and initiatives, we hope to make major conceptual, methodological and analytical contributions towards large integrative cohorts and their efficient exploitation. We will thus provide novel information on {BCM} health maintenance, as well as the onset and course of {BCM} disorders. This will lay a foundation for earlier diagnosis of brain disorders, aberrant development and decline of {BCM} health, and translate into future preventive and therapeutic strategies. Aiming to improve clinical practice and public health we will work with stakeholders and health authorities, and thus provide the evidence base for prevention and intervention.},

	abstract = {Reduced moment-to-moment blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) signal variability has been consistently linked to advanced age and poorer cognitive performance, showing potential as a functional marker of brain aging. To date, however, this promise has rested exclusively on cross-sectional comparisons. In a sample of 74 healthy adults, we provide the first longitudinal evidence linking individual differences in {BOLD} variability, age, and performance across multiple cognitive domains over an average period of 2.5 years. As expected, those expressing greater loss of {BOLD} variability also exhibited greater decline in cognition. The fronto-striato-thalamic system emerged as a core neural substrate for these change–change associations. Preservation of signal variability within regions of the fronto-striato-thalamic system also cohered with preservation of functional integration across regions of this system, suggesting that longitudinal maintenance of “local” dynamics may require across-region communication. We therefore propose this neural system as a primary target in future longitudinal studies on the neural substrates of cognitive aging. Given that longitudinal change–change associations between brain and cognition are notoriously difficult to detect, the presence of such an association within a relatively short follow-up period bolsters the promise of brain signal variability as a viable, experimentally sensitive probe for studying individual differences in human cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {As the brain matures, its responses become optimized. Behavioral measures show this through improved accuracy and decreased trial-to-trial variability. The question remains whether the supporting brain dynamics show a similar decrease in variability. We examined the relation between variability in single trial evoked electrical activity of the brain (measured with {EEG}) and performance of a face memory task in children (8–15 y) and young adults (20–33 y). Behaviorally, children showed slower, more variable response times ({RT}), and less accurate recognition than adults. However, brain signal variability increased with age, and showed strong negative correlations with intrasubject {RT} variability and positive correlations with accuracy. Thus, maturation appears to lead to a brain with greater functional variability, which is indicative of enhanced neural complexity. This variability may reflect a broader repertoire of metastable brain states and more fluid transitions among them that enable optimum responses. Our results suggest that the moment-to-moment variability in brain activity may be a critical index of the cognitive capacity of the brain.},

Growth models constitute a flexible framework for modeling a range of complex trajectories across time in outcomes of interest, including non-linearities and time-varying covariates. However, these models can be expanded to include the effects of multiple growth processes at once on a single outcome. Here, I outline such an extension, showing how multiple growth processes can be modeled as a specific case of the general ability to include time-varying covariates in growth models. I show that this extension of growth models cannot be accomplished by statistical models alone, and that study design plays a crucial role in allowing for proper parameter recovery. I demonstrate these principles through simulations to mimic important theoretical conditions where modeling the effects of multiple growth processes can address developmental theory including, disaggregating the effects of age and practice or treatment in repeated assessments and modeling age- and puberty-related effects during adolescence. I compare how these models behave in two common longitudinal designs, cohort and accelerated, and how planned missingness in observations is key to parameter recovery. I conclude with directions for future substantive research using the method outlined here.},

	abstract = {It is well established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the life span. A long-standing hypothesis called “age differentiation” additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date, however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multigroup structural equation models ({SEMs}) and {SEM} trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult life span (18–88 years) in a large (N {\textgreater} 646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.org). After factor analyses of gray matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted {MRI}) and white matter organization (fractional anisotropy from diffusion-weighted {MRI}), we found evidence for the differentiation of gray and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation among fluid intelligence, language, and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern among cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with the reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships among cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (dedifferentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult life span sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change among cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language, and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.},

A few general conceptual accounts for these empirical findings are presented, along with a short description of an attempt to formally integrate these 2 sets of findings and explanations at a purely descriptive level. The authors then present empirical findings on aging-induced deterioration of neurotransmitter systems and the increase in {CNS} variability at the biological level. The authors propose a computational approach which varies the responsivity of the processing units and the internal variability of connectionist networks by manipulating the gain parameter of the sigmoid activation function. The authors then report 2 sets of simulations, each involving 3 groups of networks that differ only in the means of the uniform distributions from which values of gain parameters were sampled. The authors then examine the effect of this gain parameter manipulation on the intercorrelations between the networks' performances in 2 task domains. Finally, the authors discuss the limitations of the present formalization and its implications for the study of lifespan cognitive development.

To estimate these models, maximum likelihood ({ML}) approaches have been applied because they are the default in latent variable software. However, one drawback of {ML} is that it tends to suffer from estimation problems such as nonconvergence when the sample size is small to moderate, and the results that come from nonconverged solutions are useless in research practice. Nonconvergence is a particularly serious problem when more complex multilevel {SEMs} are estimated. Therefore, in this article, we show how factor score regression ({FSR}) can be used to obtain estimates of multilevel mediation, moderation, and nonlinear effects. We conducted two simulation studies to validate our approaches. Our findings were generally promising, which renders {FSR} an attractive alternative to {ML}.},

An existing approach incorporated the principal component analysis ({PCA}) to address this challenge based on the fact that the transformed mediators are conditionally independent given the orthogonality of the principal components ({PCs}). However, the transformed mediator {PCs}, which are linear combinations of original mediators, can be difficult to interpret. A sparse high-dimensional mediation analysis approach is proposed which adopts the sparse {PCA} method to the mediation setting.

Pharmacokinetics in women is affected by lower body weight, slower gastrointestinal motility, less intestinal enzymatic activity, and slower glomerular filtration rate. Because of delayed gastric emptying, women may need to extend the interval between eating and taking medications that must be absorbed on an empty stomach. Other physiologic differences may affect medication dosages. For example, because renal clearance is slower in women, some renally-excreted medications, such as digoxin, may require a dosage adjustment. Pharmacodynamic differences in women include greater sensitivity to and enhanced effectiveness of beta blockers, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and typical antipsychotics. Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. Because women are prone to torsades de pointes, medications known to prolong the {QT} interval should be used with caution. Women should receive lower dosages of digoxin and have lower serum concentration targets than men because of higher mortality rates.},

Women appear to use more pain-relieving medications than men; however, it remains unclear whether these observations represent true differences in analgesic usage patterns, or reporting bias. Differences in analgesic efficacy relating to body composition, metabolism and hormonal profiles have been demonstrated. Psychological and social elements of gender have also been associated with altered pain experiences and analgesic use profiles, albeit with significant individual variations.

However, the literature in regard to sex differences in antinociceptive responses to μ-opioids other than morphine is less consistent. The present study was designed to examine whether there is a structure-activity rationale that determines which μ-opioids will show a differential antinociceptive response between male and female rats. A series of morphinans closely related in structure to morphine, namely, codeine, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and oxycodone, were examined for their antinociceptive activity in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and compared with the structurally unrelated μ-opioid agonists methadone and fentanyl. Antinociception was measured by the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay. The results show that morphine is more potent in males compared with females {\textgreater} hydromorphone = hydrocodone = oxymorphone, but there was no observable sex difference in the antinociceptive potency of codeine, heroin, oxycodone, methadone, or fentanyl. The potency to stimulate guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35 S]thio)triphosphate ([35S]{GTPγS}) binding and binding affinity of the various morphinans was compared in rat glioma C6 cells expressing the rat μ-opioid receptor; relative efficacy was also compared by stimulation of [35S]{GTPγS} binding in slices of rat brain thalamus. The presence of a sex difference in antinociceptive responsiveness was not related to drug potency, efficacy, or affinity. Consequently, it is likely that differential metabolism of the opioid, possibly by glucuronidation, determines the presence or absence of a sex difference.},

Whereas it is known that individuals lacking {CYP}2D6 activity (poor metabolizers, {PM}) suffer from poor analgesia from codeine, ultra-fast metabolizers ({UM}) due to the {CYP}2D6 gene duplication may experience exaggerated and even potentially dangerous opioidergic effects and no systematical study has been performed so far on this question. A single dose of 30 mg codeine was administered to 12 {UM} of {CYP}2D6 substrates carrying a {CYP}2D6 gene duplication, 11 extensive metabolizers ({EM}) and three {PM}. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods and a single-base primer extension method for characterization of the gene-duplication alleles. Pharmacokinetics was measured over 24 h after drug intake and codeine and its metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences between the {EM} and {UM} groups were detected in areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves ({AUCs}) of morphine with a median (range) {AUC} of 11 (5–17) μg h l−1 in {EMs} and 16 (10–24) μg h l−1 in {UM} (P=0.02). In urine collected over 12 h, the metabolic ratios of the codeine+codeine-6-glucuronide divided by the sum of morphine+its glucuronides metabolites were 11 (6–17) in {EMs} and 9 (6–16) in {UM} (P=0.05). Ten of the 11 {CYP}2D6 {UMs} felt sedation (91\%) compared to six (50\%) of the 12 {EMs} (P=0.03). {CYP}2D6 genotypes predicting ultrarapid metabolism resulted in about 50\% higher plasma concentrations of morphine and its glucuronides compared with the {EM}. No severe adverse effects were seen in the {UMs} in our study most likely because we used for safety reasons a low dose of only 30 mg.

	doi = {10.3233/JAD-201131},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Intracranial stenosis ({ICS}) may contribute to cognitive dysfunction by decreased cerebral blood flow ({CBF}) which can be measured quantitatively by arterial spin labelling ({ASL}). Interpretation of {CBF} measurements with {ASL}, however, becomes difficult in patients with vascular disease due to prolonged arterial transit time ({ATT}). Recently, spatial coefficient of variation ({sCoV}) of {ASL} signal has been proposed that approximates {ATT} and utilized as a proxy marker for assessment of hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation.
{OBJECTIVE}: We investigate the association of {ICS} with {CBF} and {sCoV} parameters and its eventual effects on cognition in a memory clinic population.
{METHODS}: We included 381 patients (mean age = 72.3±7.9 years, women = 53.7\%) who underwent 3T {MRI} and detailed neuropsychological assessment. {ICS} was defined as≥50\% stenosis in any intracranial vessel on 3D Time-of-Flight {MR} Angiography. Gray matter {sCoV} and {CBF} were obtained from 2D {EPI} pseudo-continuous {ASL} images.
{RESULTS}: {ICS} was present in 58 (15.2\%) patients. Patients with {ICS} had higher gray matter {sCoV} and lower {CBF}. The association with {sCoV} remained statistically significant after correction for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, {ICS} was associated with worse performance on visuoconstruction, which attenuated with higher {sCoV}. Mediation analysis showed that there was an indirect effect of {ICS} on visuoconstruction via {sCoV}.
{CONCLUSION}: These findings suggest that compromised {CBF} as detected by higher {sCoV} is related to cognitive impairment among individuals diagnosed with {ICS}. We also showed that {sCoV} partially mediates the link between {ICS} and cognition. Therefore, {sCoV} may provide valuable hemodynamic information in patients with vascular disease.},

	abstract = {Although cognitive vulnerabilities to depression have received considerable empirical support, little research has evaluated the differential development of cognitive vulnerabilities in adolescent girls and boys. The current study examined the role of stressful life events, as well as sex differences in reactivity and exposure to stress, in the development of negative cognitive style and rumination in a multi-wave study of 382 adolescents. Path analyses indicated that interpersonal dependent stress predicted higher prospective levels of negative cognitive styles and rumination. Additionally, girls’ greater exposure to interpersonal dependent stress explained their higher levels of rumination, which accounted for girls’ higher levels of depressive symptoms than boys. These findings suggest that interpersonal dependent stress is a significant risk factor for the formation of cognitive vulnerabilities to depression during adolescence, and that the sex difference in depressive symptoms may result from girls’ greater exposure to interpersonal dependent stress and ruminative response style than boys.},

	abstract = {Questionable research practices ({QRPs}) can occur whenever one result is favored over another, and tests of mediation are no exception. Given mediation’s ubiquity and importance to both theory and practice, {QRPs} in tests of mediation pose a serious threat to the advancement of psychology. We investigate this issue through the introduction of a straightforward means of detecting the presence and magnitude of {QRPs} in tests of mediation and validate this methodology with a series of sensitivity tests and simulations. We then apply this method to 2,569 tests of mediation published in five leading psychology journals in 2018 and 2019. We find that despite most hypothesized tests of mediation being likely underpowered, most (76\%) were nevertheless supported. Furthermore, confidence intervals ({CIs}) that just barely exclude zero are 3.6 to 4.4 times as prevalent as those {CIs} that just barely include zero. We also find a number of study- and test-level factors, such as whether the test of mediation was hypothesized, explain both whether the {CI} excluded zero (odds ratio [{OR}] = 17.87, p {\textless} .001) as well as the {CI}’s proximity to zero (b = .27, p {\textless} .001). In addition, other factors, most notably sample size, do predict the {CI}’s proximity to zero (γ = .00, p {\textless} .001), but surprisingly do not predict the {CI}’s exclusion of zero ({OR} = .99, p = .803). We conclude with actionable {QRP} curtailment strategies so that both, academics and practitioners, can have greater and well-founded confidence in tests of mediation in psychological research.

	abstract = {In psychology, the causal process between 2 variables can be studied with statistical mediation analysis. To make a causal interpretation about the relation between variables, researchers who use the statistical mediation model make many assumptions about the variables in the model, among which are measurement assumptions about the mediator. For example, researchers often assume that the measure of the mediator yields scores that are reliable and that have a valid interpretation. In this article, we address how several measurement challenges affect the conclusions of statistical mediation analysis, and how researchers can use different psychometric models to study theoretically different causal processes. We use simulated data sets to illustrate how 10 well-fitting and theoretically sound statistical mediation models could significantly detect the indirect effect or miss it entirely depending on how the mediator is represented in the model. In the example, power to detect the indirect effect varied by the amount of true mediator variance that the psychometric model of the mediator was able to isolate. Different strategies to incorporate psychometric methods into mediation research are discussed and future directions are considered. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Researchers and prevention scientists often develop interventions to target intermediate variables (known as mediators) that are thought to be related to an outcome. When researchers target a mediating construct measured by self-report, the meaning of the self-report measure could change from pretest to posttest for the individuals who received the intervention?which is a phenomenon referred to as response shift. As a result, any observed changes on the mediator measure across groups or across time might reflect a combination of true change on the construct and response shift. Although previous studies have focused on identifying the source and type of response shift in measures after an intervention, there has been limited research on how using sum scores in the presence of response shift affects the estimation of mediated effects via statistical mediation analysis, which is critical for explaining how the intervention worked. In this article, we focus on recalibration response shift, which is a change in internal standards of measurement and affects how respondents interpret the response scale. We provide background on the theory of response shift and the methodology used to detect response shift (i.e., tests of measurement invariance). In addition, we used simulated data sets to provide an illustration of how recalibration in the mediator can bias estimates of the mediated effect and affect Type I error and power.},

Accompanying this growth has been the belief that we can classify indicators into two categories, effect (reflective) indicators and causal (formative) indicators. This paper argues that the dichotomous view is too simple. Instead, there are effect indicators and three types of variables on which a latent variable depends: causal indicators, composite (formative) indicators, and covariates (the “three Cs”). Causal indicators have conceptual unity and their effects on latent variables are structural. Covariates are not concept measures, but are variables to control to avoid bias in estimating the relations between measures and latent variable(s). Composite (formative) indicators form exact linear combinations of variables that need not share a concept. Their coefficients are weights rather than structural effects and composites are a matter of convenience. The failure to distinguish the “three Cs” has led to confusion and questions such as: are causal and formative indicators different names for the same indicator type? Should an equation with causal or formative indicators have an error term? Are the coefficients of causal indicators less stable than effect indicators? Distinguishing between causal and composite indicators and covariates goes a long way toward eliminating this confusion. We emphasize the key role that subject matter expertise plays in making these distinctions. We provide new guidelines for working with these variable types, including identification of models, scaling latent variables, parameter estimation, and validity assessment. A running empirical example on self-perceived health illustrates our major points.},

Believing that a peer was actively watching them was sufficient to induce self-conscious emotion that rose in magnitude from childhood to adolescence and partially subsided into adulthood. Autonomic arousal was uniquely heightened in adolescents. These behavioral patterns were paralleled by emergent engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) and striatum-{MPFC} connectivity during adolescence, which are thought to promote motivated social behavior in adolescence. These findings demonstrate that adolescents' self-consciousness is related to age-dependent sensitivity of brain systems critical to socioaffective processes.

Second, age differences and age changes in brain and cognition are often nonlinear. Third, variances and correlations among measures of brain and cognition frequently vary with age. Fourth, cross-sectional comparisons among competing models of {ABC} associations cannot disambiguate com-peting hypotheses about the structure and the range of directed and reciprocal relations between changes in brain and behavior. We offer the following conclusions, based on these observations. First, individual differences among younger adults are not useful for understanding the aging of brain and behavior. Second, only multivariate longitudinal studies, age-comparative experimental interventions, and a com-bination of the two will deliver us from the predicaments of the {ABC} triangle described by Salthouse. Mediation models of cross-sectional data represent age-related differences in target variables but fail to approximate time-dependent relations; thus, they do not elucidate the dimensions and dynamics of cognitive aging.},

The current paper used a Monte Carlo simulation design to study score quality for different psychometric models that did and did not include covariates across levels of sample size, number of items, and degree of measurement invariance. The inclusion of covariates improved score quality for nearly all design factors, and in no case did the covariates degrade score quality relative to not considering the influences at all.

	abstract = {Longitudinal data is becoming increasingly available in developmental neuroimaging. To maximize the promise of this wealth of information on how biology, behavior, and cognition change over time, there is a need to incorporate broad and rigorous training in longitudinal methods into the repertoire of developmental neuroscientists. Fortunately, these models have an incredibly rich tradition in the broader developmental sciences that we can draw from.  Here, we provide a primer on longitudinal models, written in a beginner-friendly (and slightly irreverent) manner, with a particular focus on selecting among different modeling frameworks (e.g., multilevel versus latent curve models) to build the theoretical model of development a researcher wishes to test. Our aims are three-fold: 1) lay out a heuristic framework for longitudinal model selection, 2) build a repository of references that ground each model in its tradition of methodological development and practical implementation with a focus on connecting researchers to resources outside traditional neuroimaging journals, and 3) provide practical resources in the form of a codebook companion demonstrating how to fit these models. These resources together aim to enhance training for the next generation of developmental neuroscientists by providing a solid foundation for future forays into advanced modeling applications.},

Therefore, we sought to elucidate the factorial structure and neural substrates of child and adolescent intelligence using two cross-sectional, developmental samples ({CALM}: N = 551 (N = 165 imaging), age range: 5–18 years, {NKI}-Rockland: N = 337 (N = 65 imaging), age range: 6–18 years). In a preregistered analysis, we used structural equation modelling ({SEM}) to examine the neurocognitive architecture of individual differences in childhood and adolescent cognitive ability. In both samples, we found that cognitive ability in lower and typical-ability cohorts is best understood as two separable constructs, crystallized and fluid intelligence, which became more distinct across development, in line with the age differentiation hypothesis. Further analyses revealed that white matter microstructure, most prominently the superior longitudinal fasciculus, was strongly associated with crystallized (gc) and fluid (gf) abilities. Finally, we used {SEM} trees to demonstrate evidence for developmental reorganization of gc and gf and their white matter substrates such that the relationships among these factors dropped between 7–8 years before increasing around age 10. Together, our results suggest that shortly before puberty marks a pivotal phase of change in the neurocognitive architecture of intelligence.},

	abstract = {Background: Fluid intelligence declines with advancing age, starting in early adulthood. Within-subject declines in fluid intelligence are highly correlated with contemporaneous declines in the ability to live and function independently. To support healthy aging, the mechanisms underlying these declines need to be better understood., 
Methods: In this pre-registered analysis, we applied latent growth curve modelling to investigate the neural determinants of longitudinal changes in fluid intelligence across three time points in 185,317 individuals (N=9,719 two waves, N=870 three waves) from the {UK} Biobank (age range: 39-73 years)., 
Results: We found a weak but significant effect of cross-sectional age on the mean fluid intelligence score, such that older individuals scored slightly lower. However, the mean longitudinal slope was positive, rather than negative, suggesting improvement across testing occasions. Despite the considerable sample size, the slope variance was non-significant, suggesting no reliable individual differences in change over time. This null-result is likely due to the nature of the cognitive test used. In a subset of individuals, we found that white matter microstructure (N=8839, as indexed by fractional anisotropy) and grey-matter volume (N=9931) in pre-defined regions-of-interest accounted for complementary and unique variance in mean fluid intelligence scores. The strongest effects were such that higher grey matter volume in the frontal pole and greater white matter microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiations were associated with higher fluid intelligence scores., 
Conclusions: In a large preregistered analysis, we demonstrate a weak but significant negative association between age and fluid intelligence. However, we did not observe plausible longitudinal patterns, instead observing a weak increase across testing occasions, and no significant individual differences in rates of change, likely due to the suboptimal task design. Finally, we find support for our preregistered expectation that white- and grey matter make separate contributions to individual differences in fluid intelligence beyond age.},

This measurement strategy is incorporated in many research applications, but it is particularly salient in the study of substance use where the product of ordinal quantity (number of drinks) and frequency (number of days) items is used to create an index of total consumption. In the current study, we demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this multiplicative procedure can introduce serious threats to construct validity.

However, their potential to differentially predict age and cognitive abilities has been largely overlooked, likely because they are typically aggregated into the commonly used measure of volume. In a large sample of healthy adults (N=647, aged 18-88), we investigated the brain-age and brain-cognition relationships of thickness, surface area, and volume, plus five additional morphological shape metrics. Cortical thickness was the metric most strongly associated with age cross-sectionally, as well as exhibiting the steepest longitudinal change over time (subsample N=261, aged 25-84). In contrast, surface area was the best single predictor of age-residualized cognitive abilities (fluid intelligence), and changes in surface area were most strongly associated with cognitive change over time. These findings were replicated in an independent dataset (N=1345, aged 18-93). Our results suggest that cortical thickness and surface area make complementary contributions the age-brain-cognition triangle, and highlight the importance of considering these volumetric components separately.},

However, we find that in humans, the scaffold transforms into a physically discontinuous structure during the transition from infragranular to supragranular neuron production. As a consequence of this transformation, supragranular layer neurons arrive at their terminal positions in the cortical plate along outer radial glia ({oRG}) cell fibers. In parallel, the radial glia that contact the ventricle develop distinct gene expression profile and "truncated" morphology. We propose a supragranular layer expansion hypothesis that posits a deterministic role of {oRG} cells in the radial and tangential expansion of supragranular layers in primates, with implications for patterns of neuronal migration, area patterning, and cortical folding.},

	abstract = {Background
Child abuse is a serious social problem in the {USA} as many children suffer from child abuse and its negative consequences are severe. To prevent future victimization, it is essential to understand unique patterns of child abuse trajectories over time and the factors associated with their victimization.
Objective
The primary goal of this study was to identify individual differences in developmental trajectories of alleged physical abuse between the ages of 2 and 12.
Participants and setting
The sample included all children drawn from Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect ({LONGSCAN}), which is a consortium of five study sites (South, East, Midwest, Northwest, and Southwest).
Methods
Using the high-risk sample with Child Protective Service record reviews prior to age 4, significant variability in trajectory class membership was observed in the unconditional Latent Class Growth Analysis.
Results
Three trajectory classes were obtained from the data: Early Onset, Late Peak and Non-Victims. The findings showed that children who had an attention problem at age 4 were more likely to become members of both the Early Onset and Late Peak groups, relative to Non-victims. Also, membership in the Late Peak group was predicted by caregivers' childhood physical abuse, supporting for the cycle of physical abuse across generations. Finally, children in the Late Peak group were at the highest risk of being physically, psychologically, and sexually abused in a dating relationship at age 14.
Conclusions
These results suggest that children's internal and external behavior problems and caregivers' childhood physical abuse are predictive of child abuse trajectory class membership. Parental education programs that increase their knowledge about children with special needs and intervention programs targeting caregivers with a history of physical abuse would be beneficial to prevent child abuse (re)victimization.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) studies have predominantly focused on resting state, where ongoing dynamics are thought to reflect the brain’s intrinsic network architecture, which is thought to be broadly relevant because it persists across brain states (i.e., is state-general). However, it is unknown whether resting state is the optimal state for measuring intrinsic {FC}. We propose that latent {FC}, reflecting shared connectivity patterns across many brain states, better captures state-general intrinsic {FC} relative to measures derived from resting state alone. We estimated latent {FC} independently for each connection using leave-one-task-out factor analysis in seven highly distinct task states (24 conditions) and resting state using {fMRI} data from the Human Connectome Project. Compared with resting-state connectivity, latent {FC} improves generalization to held-out brain states, better explaining patterns of connectivity and task-evoked activation. We also found that latent connectivity improved prediction of behavior outside the scanner, indexed by the general intelligence factor ( g). Our results suggest that {FC} patterns shared across many brain states, rather than just resting state, better reflect state-general connectivity. This affirms the notion of “intrinsic” brain network architecture as a set of connectivity properties persistent across brain states, providing an updated conceptual and mathematical framework of intrinsic connectivity as a latent factor.},

Although much is known about how attentional control and working memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can distinguish between models in which working memory performance failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring {EEG} activity while participants performed the whole-report task. The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition, we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the trial-by-trial differences in working memory that we observe.},

Technical advances and large-scale datasets have allowed for the development of models capable of predicting individual differences in traits and behavior using brain connectivity measures derived from neuroimaging data. Here, we present connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM}), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior relationships from connectivity data using cross-validation. This protocol includes the following steps: 1) feature selection, 2) feature summarization, 3) model building, and 4) assessment of prediction significance. We also include suggestions for visualizing the most predictive features (i.e., brain connections). The final result should be a generalizable model that takes brain connectivity data as input and generates predictions of behavioral measures in novel subjects, accounting for a significant amount of the variance in these measures. It has been demonstrated that the {CPM} protocol performs equivalently or better than most of the existing approaches in brain-behavior prediction.

Both procedures were used to investigate whether mood ratings collected in Minnesota and China were comparable. Several issues were addressed. The first issue was that of establishing a common measurement scale across groups, which involves full or partial measurement invariance of trait indicators. It is shown that using {CFA} or {IRT} models, test items that function differentially as trait indicators across groups need not interfere with comparing examinees on the same trait dimension. Second, the issue of model fit was addressed. It is proposed that person-fit statistics be used to judge the practical fit of {IRT} models. Finally, topics for future research are suggested.},

The Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-{CID}) provides a comprehensive approach towards understanding the longitudinal developmental pathways of, and social enrichment effects on, social competence, taking into account potential differential effects of such enrichment. Using Neurosynth based brain maps we point towards the medial prefrontal cortex as an important region integrating social cognition, self-referential processing and self-control for learning to respond flexibly to changing social contexts. Based on their role in social evaluation processing, we suggest to examine medial prefrontal cortex connections with lateral prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum as potential neural differential susceptibility markers, in addition to previously established markers of differential susceptibility.},

Regular assessments included the measurement of height, weight, waist circumference, and skinfold thicknesses; pubertal development was examined by trained investigators according to Tanner stages; dietary intake was obtained by three 24-h recalls and food frequency questionnaire; validated questionnaires were used to estimate socio-demographic characteristics, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. Findings from the {CAC} baseline and the first follow-up data suggested that higher protein intake among girls and unhealthy eating habits among children might increase the risk for childhood obesity. Also, higher intakes of grain and meat and lower overall diet quality and intakes of dietary fiber and tuber might be associated with advanced pubertal development. Those results indicated that the {CAC} study could contribute to the development of strategies for optimizing Chinese children's health.},

Salivary samples were obtained from 60 boys and 60 girls at approximately 07∶45, 08∶00, 08∶30, 12∶00, 16∶50, and 21∶00 h. The participants' ages ranged from 8–14 yrs, and each participant was tested three times at six‐month intervals. The study was conducted at a General Clinical Research Center ({GCRC}) and at the homes of the participants. All hormones showed diurnal fluctuations. The acrophase (peak time) of cortisol occurred earlier than for testosterone or {DHEA} and showed a seasonal effect, with the acrophase occurring earlier in spring than in summer. The cortisol acrophase also occurred later in the day for boys than for girls during later puberty. Seasonal effects were found only for cortisol with higher concentrations in the spring and summer. Cortisol concentrations were relatively stable across pubertal maturation, but significantly lower concentrations were observed at pubertal stage 3 compared to the other stages. Morning cortisol levels were also higher in boys at pubertal stage 2. Testosterone concentrations were higher in boys at pubertal stages 3 and 4, and {DHEA} was lower at pubertal stage 1 than 3 and 4 for both boys and girls. For the total sample, there was a positive correlation between {DHEA} and testosterone during early puberty (stages 1–3) but not later puberty (stages 4–5). Awakening secretory activity correlated with daytime secretory activity for testosterone and {DHEA}, but not for cortisol. These data provide novel chronobiological information on cortisol, testosterone, and {DHEA} as it relates to sexual maturation and encourage further study on both normal and abnormal endocrine rhythms.},

This article explores the largely over-looked and under-theorized significance of the scale’s history, arguing that the study’s focus on children living in an English care institution and its material practices of documenting their growth, including photography, has important ethical and scientific implications for understanding sexual development as a bio-psycho-social process.},

Whereas most of these studies were cross-sectional, the current study uses growth curve modelling to analyse longitudinal data on 3,187 children in Flemish primary education. The results indicate season of birth effects on both grade retention and mathematics achievement during the first two years of primary school. Because the Flemish cut-off date is 31 December, children born in the fourth quarter (October-November-December) invariably are among the youngest in their grade age group. Almost 20\% of these children were found to have been retained or referred to special education by the end of Grade 2, whereas for children born in the first quarter (January-February-March), this was only 6.34\%. First quarter-born children also showed moderately higher mathematics achievement at the start of first grade. During the next two school years, this achievement gap between children born in the first and the fourth quarter narrowed significantly. Finally, differentiated instruction was not found to be related to the decrease of the season of birth effect.},

	abstract = {Heywood cases, or negative variance estimates, are a common occurrence in factor analysis and latent variable structural equation models. Though they have several potential causes, structural misspecification is among the most important. This article explains how structural misspecification can lead to a Heywood case in the population, and provides several ways to test whether a negative error variance is a symptom of structural misspecification. The authors consider z-tests based on a variety of standard errors, confidence intervals, bootstrap resampling, and likelihood-ratio-type tests. In their discussion of z-tests, the authors demonstrate which of the standard errors are consistent under different kinds of misspecification. They also introduce new tests based on the scaled chi-square difference: the test on the boundary and the signed root of the scaled chi-square difference. A simulation study assesses the performance of these tests. The authors find that signed root tests and z-tests based on the empirical sandwich and the empirical bootstrap standard errors perform best in detecting negative error variances. They outperform z-tests based on the information matrix or distribution-robust standard errors.},

The three approaches are evaluated in two distinct situations: Heywood cases caused by lack of fit and misspecification error, and Heywood cases induced from sampling fluctuations. The results indicate that in the case of sampling fluctuations the simple approach of setting the offending estimate to zero works reasonably well.

These procedures can be sensibly used to examine the degree to which a third variable (Z) accounts for the inﬂuence of an independent (X) on a dependent variable (Y) conditional on the assumption that Z actually is a mediator. However, conversely, a signiﬁcant mediation analysis result does not prove that Z is a mediator. This obvious but often neglected insight is substantiated in a simulation study. Using different causal models for generating Z (genuine mediator, spurious mediator, correlate of the dependent measure, manipulation check) it is shown that signiﬁcant mediation tests do not allow researchers to identify unique mediators, or to distinguish between alternative causal models. This basic insight, although well understood by experts in statistics, is persistently ignored in the empirical literature and in the reviewing process of even the most selective journals. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	volume = {63},
	abstract = {At its best, connectivity mapping can offer researchers great insight into how spatially disparate regions of the human brain coordinate activity during brain processing. A recent investigation conducted by Smith and colleagues (2011) on methods for estimating connectivity maps suggested that those which attempt to ascertain the direction of inﬂuence among {ROIs} rarely provide reliable results. Another problem gaining increasing attention is heterogeneity in connectivity maps. Most group-level methods require that the data come from homogeneous samples, and misleading ﬁndings may arise from current methods if the connectivity maps for individuals vary across the sample (which is likely the case). The utility of maps resulting from effective connectivity on the individual or group levels is thus diminished because they do not accurately inform researchers. The present paper introduces a novel estimation technique for {fMRI} researchers, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation ({GIMME}), which demonstrates that using information across individuals assists in the recovery of the existence of connections among {ROIs} used by Smith and colleagues (2011) and the direction of the inﬂuence. Using heterogeneous in-house data, we demonstrate that {GIMME} offers a unique improvement over current approaches by arriving at reliable group and individual structures even when the data are highly heterogeneous across individuals comprising the group. An added beneﬁt of {GIMME} is that it obtains reliable connectivity map estimates equally well using the data from resting state, block, or event-related designs. {GIMME} provides researchers with a powerful, ﬂexible tool for identifying directed connectivity maps at the group and individual levels.},

Cat-{LS} was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIMS}: Arterial stiffness is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression ({CKD}). Pulse pressure is a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness. It is unclear if pulse pressure predicts {CKD} progression in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
{METHODS}: This was prospective study involving 1494 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}) ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m2. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was measured using applanation tonometry. Pulse pressure was calculated as difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures. {CKD} progression was defined as worsening of {eGFR} categories (stage 1, ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2; stage 2, 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2; stage 3a, 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2; stage 3b, 30-44 ml/min/1.73 m2; stage 4; 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2; and stage 5, {\textless} 15 ml/min/1.73 m2) with ≥ 25\% decrease in {eGFR} from baseline.
{RESULTS}: After follow-up of up to 6 years, {CKD} progression occurred in 33.5\% of subjects. Subjects in 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles of peripheral pulse pressure experienced higher risk of {CKD} progression with unadjusted hazard ratios ({HRs}) 1.55 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.13-2.11; p = 0.006], 2.58 (1.93-3.45; p {\textless} 0.001) and 3.41 (2.58-4.52; p {\textless} 0.001). In the fully adjusted model, the association for 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles remained with {HRs} 1.40 (1.02-1.93; p = 0.038), 1.87 (1.37-2.56; p {\textless} 0.001) and 1.75 (1.25-2.44; p = 0.001) respectively. Similarly, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles of aortic pulse pressure were associated with higher hazards of {CKD} progression with {HRs} 1.73 (1.25-2.40; p = 0.001), 1.65 (1.18-2.29; p = 0.003) and 1.81 (1.26-2.60; p = 0.001). Increasing urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio accounted for 44.0\% of the association between peripheral pulse pressure and {CKD} progression.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Individuals with high pulse pressure were more susceptible to deterioration of renal function. Pulse pressure could potentially be incorporated in clinical practice as an inexpensive and readily available biomarker of renal decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Graphic abstract.},

We tested the relationship between self-reported frequency of cannabis exposure and list-sorting working memory task performance (total number of correct responses), between T1 weighted {MRI}-derived regional grey-matter volumes and working memory task performance as well as between frequency of cannabis exposure and brain volumes after controlling for potential confounders. Finally, mediation analysis was carried out to test whether deficit in working memory performance associated with cannabis use was mediated by its association with lower grey-matter volume. Participants who reported higher frequency of cannabis use tended to have lower number of correct responses in the list-sorting working memory task and lower bilateral hippocampal volumes. Association between severity of cannabis exposure as indexed by frequency of cannabis use and impairment in working memory was mediated by lower left hippocampal volume in cannabis users. We report evidence in support of the left hippocampus volume-mediated working memory impairment associated with recreational cannabis exposure.

	abstract = {Background The hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating body weight through its interactions with multiple brain circuits involved in distinct aspects of feeding behavior. Yet, how hypothalamic gray matter volume ({GMV}) and connectivity may be related to individual differences in body weight remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the hypothalamus shows enhanced resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) with regions of the reward, motivation, and motor circuits in positive correlation with body mass index ({BMI}) and the opposite with those associated with inhibitory control. We further examined the interdependent relationships between hypothalamic {GMV}, connectivity, and body weight.
Methods Using seed-based {rsFC} and voxel-based morphometry analyses, we examined the relationship between the {rsFC} and {GMV} of the hypothalamus and {BMI} in 105 healthy humans. Additionally, we employed mediation analyses to characterize the inter-relationships between hypothalamic connectivity, {GMV}, and {BMI}.
Results A whole-brain multiple regression showed that {BMI} was positively correlated with hypothalamic {rsFC} with the insula, thalamus, globus pallidus, and cerebellum, and negatively correlated with hypothalamic {rsFC} with the superior parietal lobule. Thus, higher {BMI} was associated with enhanced hypothalamic connectivity with regions involved in motivated feeding and reduced connectivity with those in support of cognitive control of food intake. A second whole-brain multiple regression revealed a positive correlation between hypothalamic {GMV} and the hypothalamus–posterior insula connectivity. Finally, the relationship between hypothalamic {GMV} and {BMI} was signiﬁcantly and bidirectionally mediated by the hypothalamus–posterior insula connectivity.
Conclusions The current ﬁndings suggest that the hypothalamus differentially interacts with the motivation, motor, and control circuits to regulate {BMI}. We further found evidence for the interdependence of hypothalamic structure, function, and body weight, which provides potential insights into the brain mechanisms of obesity.},

	abstract = {Background:  Mediation analysis methodology underwent many advancements throughout the years, with the most recent and important advancement being the development of causal mediation analysis based on the counterfactual framework. However, a previous review showed that for experimental studies the uptake of causal mediation analysis remains low. The aim of this paper is to review the methodological characteristics of mediation analyses performed in observational epidemiologic studies published between 2015 and 2019 and to provide recommendations for the application of mediation analysis in future studies.
Methods:  We searched the {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} databases for observational epidemiologic studies published between 2015 and 2019 in which mediation analysis was applied as one of the primary analysis methods. Information was extracted on the characteristics of the mediation model and the applied mediation analysis method.
Results:  We included 174 studies, most of which applied traditional mediation analysis methods (n = 123, 70.7\%). Causal mediation analysis was not often used to analyze more complicated mediation models, such as multiple mediator models. Most studies adjusted their analyses for measured confounders, but did not perform sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounders and did not assess the presence of an exposure-mediator interaction.
Conclusions:  To ensure a causal interpretation of the effect estimates in the mediation model, we recommend that researchers use causal mediation analysis and assess the plausibility of the causal assumptions. The uptake of causal mediation analysis can be enhanced through tutorial papers that demonstrate the application of causal mediation analysis, and through the development of software packages that facilitate the causal mediation analysis of relatively complicated mediation models.},

	abstract = {Most empirical tests of mediation utilize cross-sectional data despite the fact that mediation consists of causal processes that unfold over time. The authors considered the possibility that longitudinal mediation might occur under either of two different models of change: (a) an autoregressive model or (b) a random effects model. For both models, the authors demonstrated that cross-sectional approaches to mediation typically generate substantially biased estimates of longitudinal parameters even under the ideal conditions when mediation is complete. In longitudinal models where variable M completely mediates the effect of X on Y, cross-sectional estimates of the direct effect of X on Y, the indirect effect of X on Y through M, and the proportion of the total effect mediated by M are often highly misleading.},

These identiﬁcation conditions can be validated algorithmically from the diagramatic description of one’s model, and are guaranteed to produce unbiased results whenever the description is correct. The identiﬁcation conditions can be further relaxed in parametric models, possibly including interactions, and permit us to compare the relative importance of several pathways, mediated by interdependent variables.},

In this article, we outline a second-order nonlinear growth model in order to measure a critical notion in development and education: potential. Here, potential is conceptualized as having three components—ability, capacity, and availability—where ability is the amount of skill a student is estimated to have at a given timepoint, capacity is the maximum amount of ability a student is predicted to be able to develop asymptotically, and availability is the difference between capacity and ability at any particular timepoint. We argue that single timepoint measures are typically insufficient for discerning information about potential, and we therefore describe a general framework that incorporates a growth model into the measurement model to capture these three components. Then, we provide an illustrative example using the public-use Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten data set using a Michaelis-Menten growth function (reparameterized from its common application in biochemistry) to demonstrate our proposed model as applied to measuring potential within an educational context. The advantage of this approach compared to currently utilized methods is discussed as are future directions and limitations.},

There is increasing interest, but little substantive theory, in the role the variables in these data play in known processes. This necessitates exploratory mediation analysis, for which structural equation modeling is the benchmark method. However, this method cannot perform mediation analysis with more variables than observations. One option is to run a series of univariate mediation models, which incorrectly assumes independence of the mediators. Another option is regularization, but the available implementations may lead to high false-positive rates. In this article, we develop a hybrid approach which uses components of both ﬁlter and regularization: the ‘Coordinate-wise Mediation Filter’. It performs ﬁltering conditional on the other selected mediators. We show through simulation that it improves performance over existing methods.

	abstract = {Objective
The current study examined whether year-to-year variability in cognitive performance differ between individuals cognitively unimpaired and individuals who subsequently develop dementia.

Method
Analyses included a case-control sample of Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging ({BLSA}; M age = 69.90, {SD} = 8.92) participants. One hundred and thirty five clinically diagnosed demented participants were matched with 135 non-demented participants based on age at initial testing and sex. Cognitive performance was examined using measures of memory, executive function, attention, language, and global mental status performance. Cognitive performance was examined from baseline to 5 years before cognitive impairment (mean assessments = 3.03, {SD} = 2.80).

Results
Compared to unimpaired individuals, individuals diagnosed with dementia had greater variability on measures of attention, executive function, language, and semantic memory at least 5 years before the estimated onset of cognitive impairment, which may be indicative of maladaptive cognitive functioning. The dementia cases, however, had less variability on visual memory than the unimpaired group, which may suggest that these cases had more difficulty learning.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate that performance variability indexed over annual or biennial visits may be useful in identifying early signs of subsequent cognitive impairment.},

Objectives To investigate and quantify age differences in {RT} {IIV} in healthy ageing; to examine the effect of different tasks and procedures; to compare raw and mean-adjusted measures of {RT} {IIV}. Data Sources Four electronic databases: {PsycINFO}, Medline, Web of Science and {EMBASE}, and hand searching of reference lists of relevant studies. Study Eligibility English language journal articles, books or book chapters, containing quantitative empirical data on simple and/or choice {RT} {IIV}. Samples had to include younger (under 60 years) and older (60 years and above) human adults. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Studies were evaluated in terms of sample representativeness and data treatment. Relevant data were extracted, using a specially-designed form, from the published report or obtained directly from the study authors. Age-group differences in raw and {RT}-mean-adjusted measures of simple and choice {RT} {IIV} were quantified using random effects meta-analyses. Results Older adults (60+ years) had greater {RT} {IIV} than younger (20–39) and middle-aged (40–59) adults. Age effects were larger in choice {RT} tasks than in simple {RT} tasks. For all measures of {RT} {IIV}, effect sizes were larger for the comparisons between older and younger adults than between older and middle-aged adults, indicating that the age-related increases in {RT} {IIV} are not limited to old age. Effect sizes were also larger for raw than for {RT}-mean-adjusted {RT} {IIV} measures. Conclusions {RT} {IIV} is greater among older adults. Some (but not all) of the age-related increases in {RT} {IIV} are accounted for by the increased {RT} means.},

They next show that the within-person variation over weekly measurements is coherent information rather than 'noise' and that individual differences in magnitude of week-to-week variability are a relatively stable attribute that predicts mortality status 5 years later.

That is, cognitive performance is degraded when processing is slow because relevant operations cannot be successfully executed(limited time) and because the products of early  processing may no longer be available when later processing is complete ( simultaneity ) . Several types of evidence, such as the discovery of considerable shared age-related variance across various measures of speed and large attenuation of the age-related influences on cognitive measures after statistical control of measures of speed, are consistent with this theory.

This coordination operates within noisy, overlapping, and distributed neural networks operating at multiple timescales. These networks are built upon a structural scaffolding with intrinsic neuroplasticity that changes with development, aging, disease, and personal experience. In this article, we begin from the perspective that successful interregional communication relies upon the transient synchronization between distinct low-frequency (,80 Hz) oscillations, allowing for brief windows of communication via phase-coordinated local neuronal spiking. From this, we construct a theoretical framework for dynamic network communication, arguing that these networks reﬂect a balance between oscillatory coupling and local population spiking activity and that these two levels of activity interact. We theorize that when oscillatory coupling is too strong, spike timing within the local neuronal population becomes too synchronous; when oscillatory coupling is too weak, spike timing is too disorganized. Each results in speciﬁc disruptions to neural communication. These alterations in communication dynamics may underlie cognitive changes associated with healthy development and aging, in addition to neurological and psychiatric disorders. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders —including Parkinson’s disease, autism, depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety—are associated with abnormalities in oscillatory activity. Although aging, psychiatric and neurological disease, and experience differ in the biological changes to structural gray or white matter, neurotransmission, and gene expression, our framework suggests that any resultant cognitive and behavioral changes in normal or disordered states or their treatment are a product of how these physical processes affect dynamic network communication.},

Emerging models have postulated that predictive mechanisms require synchronous ﬁring of neural networks, but to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily through oscillatory activity in narrow frequency bands. A recently-developed measure proposed to reﬂect broadband neural activity – and thereby synchronous neuronal ﬁring – is 1/f neural noise extracted from {EEG} spectral power. Previous research has indicated that this measure of 1/f neural noise changes across the lifespan, and these neural changes predict age-related behavioral impairments in visual working memory. Using a cross-sectional sample of young and older adults, we examined age-related changes in 1/f neural noise and whether this measure predicted {ERP} correlates of successful lexical prediction during discourse comprehension. 1/f neural noise across two different language tasks revealed high within-subject correlations, indicating that this measure can provide a reliable index of individualized patterns of neural activation. In addition to age, 1/f noise was a signiﬁcant predictor of N400 effects of successful lexical prediction; however, noise did not mediate age-related declines in other {ERP} effects. We discuss broader implications of these ﬁndings for theories of predictive processing, as well as potential applications of 1/f noise across research populations.},

	abstract = {Interaction and quadratic effects in latent variable models have to date only rarely been tested in practice. Traditional product indicator approaches need to create product indicators (e.g., x12; x1x4) to serve as indicators of each nonlinear latent construct. These approaches require the use of complex nonlinear constraints and additional model speciﬁcations and do not directly address the nonnormal distribution of the product terms. In contrast, recently developed, easy-to-use distribution analytic approaches do not use product indicators, but rather directly model the nonlinear multivariate distribution of the measured indicators. This article outlines the theoretical properties of the distribution analytic Latent Moderated Structural Equations ({LMS}; Klein \& Moosbrugger, 2000) and Quasi-Maximum Likelihood ({QML}; Klein \& Muthén, 2007) estimators. It compares the properties of {LMS} and {QML} to those of the product indicator approaches. A small simulation study compares the two approaches and illustrates the advantages of the distribution analytic approaches as multicollinearity increases, particularly in complex models with multiple nonlinear terms. An empirical example from the ﬁeld of work stress applies {LMS} and {QML} to a model with an interaction and 2 quadratic effects. Example syntax for the analyses with both approaches is provided.},

	abstract = {The unconstrained product indicator ({PI}) approach is a simple and popular approach for modeling nonlinear effects among latent variables. This approach leaves the practitioner to choose the {PIs} to be included in the model, introducing arbitrariness into the modeling. In contrast to previous Monte Carlo studies, we evaluated the {PI} approach by 3 post hoc analyses applied to a real-world case adopted from a research effort in social psychology. The measurement design applied 3 and 4 indicators for the 2 latent 1st-order variables, leaving the researcher with a choice among more than 4,000 possible {PI} configurations. Sixty so-called matched-pair configurations that have been recommended in previous literature are of special interest. In the 1st post hoc analysis we estimated the interaction effect for all {PI} configurations, keeping the real-world sample fixed. The estimated interaction effect was substantially affected by the choice of {PIs}, also across matched-pair configurations. Subsequently, a post hoc Monte Carlo study was conducted, with varying sample sizes and data distributions. Convergence, bias, Type I error and power of the interaction test were investigated for each matched-pair configuration and the all-pairs configuration. Variation in estimates across matched-pair configurations for a typical sample was substantial. The choice of specific configuration significantly affected convergence and the interaction test’s outcome. The all-pairs configuration performed overall better than the matched-pair configurations. A further advantage of the all-pairs over the matched-pairs approach is its unambiguity. The final study evaluates the all-pairs configuration for small sample sizes and compares it to the non-{PI} approach of latent moderated structural equations.

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a randomeffects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	abstract = {This didactic article aims to provide a gentle introduction to penalized splines as a way of estimating nonlinear growth curves in which many observations are collected over time on a single or multiple individuals. We begin by presenting piecewise linear models in which the time domain of the data is divided into consecutive phases and a separate linear regression line is fitted in each phase. Linear splines add the feature that the regression lines fitted in adjacent phases are always joined at the boundary so there is no discontinuity in level between phases. Splines are highly flexible raising the fundamental tradeoff between model fit and smoothness of the curve. Penalized spline models address this tradeoff by introducing a penalty term to achieve balance between fit and smoothness. The linear mixed-effects model, familiar from multilevel analysis, is introduced as a method for estimating penalized spline models. Higher order spline models using quadratic or cubic functions which further enhance a smooth fit are introduced. Technical issues in estimation, hypothesis testing, and constructing confidence intervals for higher order penalized spline models are considered. We then use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to illustrate each step in fitting a higher order penalized spline model, and to illustrate hypothesis testing, the construction of confidence intervals, and the comparison of the functions in 2 groups (boys and girls). Extensive graphical illustrations are provided throughout. Annotated computer scripts using the R package nlme are provided in online supplemental materials.

The current article uses both simulated and real data to examine the utility of a recently proposed psychometric model for multiple reporter data called the trifactor model ({TFM}) in settings that might be commonly found in prevention research. Results suggest that numerical scores obtained using the {TFM} are superior to more traditional methods, particularly when pooling samples that contribute different reporter perspectives.},

The underlying neural correlates have remained speculative however, in spite of known white matter degradation seen in conjunction with elevated inconsistency in related operationalizations of intraindividual variability. Consistently, these operationalizations have controlled for artifactual age-related variance to increase measurement sensitivity of {CNS} dysfunction. In this study, dispersion was examined alongside composite scores of memory and executive functioning from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}). Forty-four healthy older adults (M = 72.0, {SD} = 6.4) underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI}) and neuropsychological testing spanning a range of cognitive domains. The results replicated previous findings, demonstrating reduced microstructural integrity with advanced age and increased integrity in high memory and executive functioning performers, across all major white matter tracts. With age first regressed from the composite scores, significant associations remained between greater executive functioning scores and greater microstructural integrity in the genu of the corpus callosum, right anterior corona radiata, anterior, posterior and rentrolenticular parts of right internal capsule, as well as right posterior thalamic radiation. With age regressed from the dispersion scores, greater values were primarily associated with decreased white matter integrity in the body and genu of corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata bilaterally and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Dispersion is easily computed across speeded and accuracy-based measures and shows promise in detecting white matter damage, beyond that seen in the typical aging process. This appears to be the first investigation of neural correlates associated with increased dispersion.},

Model-based composite scores of latent variables account for measurement error in the aggregated variables.

The degree to which our statistical models fail to correspond to our theoretical models undermines our ability to validly test developmental theory. The broad class of random coefficient trajectory (or growth curve) models allow us to test our theories in ways not previously possible. Despite these advantages, there remain certain limits with regard to the types of questions these models can currently evaluate. We explore these issues through the pursuit of three goals. First, we provide an overview of a variety of trajectory models that can be used for rigorously testing many hypotheses in developmental psychopathology. Second, we highlight what types of research questions are well tested using these methods and what types of questions currently are not.

When the degree is much smaller than the number of time points and the correlations between adjacent time points are not too large, cross-sectional and mixed longitudinal designs are more efficient than a longitudinal design.

In others, they are the result of incomplete modeling of the process and are spurious rather than substantive. In this report, we show that when the true relation between a dependent variable and age is non-linear (e.g. quadratic), but is modeled as linear, the estimated age effect will be a function of the age distribution. In a continuous-time idealization, if the age distribution is Gaussian, the estimated age effects agree. If the age distribution is symmetric and the non-linearity is quadratic, cross-sectional and longitudinal results agree. Otherwise they do not.

	abstract = {Small samples sizes are a pervasive problem when modeling clustered data. In two-level models, this problem has been well studied, and several resources provide guidance for modeling such data. However, a recent review of small-sample clustered data methods has noted that no studies have investigated methods for modeling three-level data with small sample sizes. Furthermore, strategies for two-level models do not necessarily translate to the three-level context. Moreover, three-level models are prone to small samples because the “small sample” designation is primarily based on the sample size of the highest level, and large samples are increasingly difficult to amass as one progresses up a hierarchy. In this study, we focus on the case when the third level is incidental, meaning that the third level is important to consider but there are no explicit research questions at the third level. This study performs a simulation study to examine the performance of seven methods for modeling threelevel data with a small sample at the third level. A motivating educational psychology example is also provided to demonstrate how the choice of method can greatly affect results.},

First, we deﬁne the disaggregation of effects in grouped data, and then we extend these concepts to repeated measures. Then we review several available modeling strategies that capture these effects to varying degrees and raise three issues that can help to guide practice.},

	abstract = {Arguments are proposed that researchers using longitudinal data should consider more and less complex statistical model alternatives to their initially chosen techniques in an effort to “right-size” the model to the data at hand. Such model comparisons may alert researchers who use poorly fitting, overly parsimonious models to more complex, better-fitting alternatives and, alternatively, may identify more parsimonious alternatives to overly complex (and perhaps empirically underidentified and/or less powerful) statistical models. A general framework is proposed for considering (often nested) relationships between a variety of psychometric and growth curve models. A 3-step approach is proposed in which models are evaluated based on the number and patterning of variance components prior to selection of better-fitting growth models that explain both mean and variation– covariation patterns. The orthogonal free curve slope intercept ({FCSI}) growth model is considered a general model that includes, as special cases, many models, including the factor mean ({FM}) model ({McArdle} \& Epstein, 1987), {McDonald}’s (1967) linearly constrained factor model, hierarchical linear models ({HLMs}), repeatedmeasures multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA}), and the linear slope intercept ({linearSI}) growth model. The {FCSI} model, in turn, is nested within the Tuckerized factor model. The approach is illustrated by comparing alternative models in a longitudinal study of children’s vocabulary and by comparing several candidate parametric growth and chronometric models in a Monte Carlo study.},

Hippocampal volume was measured in 434 healthy participants between 8 and 85 years of age, and quadratic models were fit to subsets of the sample with different age-ranges. It was found that as the bottom of the age-range increased, the age at which volumes appeared to peak was moved upwards and the estimated decline in the last part of the age-span became larger. Thus, whether children were included or not affected the estimated decline between 60 and 85 years. We conclude that caution should be exerted in inferring age-trajectories from global fit models, e.g. the quadratic model.

Development progressed with a steep initial improvement in performance followed by stabilization in adolescence. Adult-level mature performance began at approximately 15, 14, and 19 years of age for processing speed, response inhibition, and working memory, respectively. Although processes developed in-dependently, processing speed influenced the development of working memory whereas the development of response suppression and working memory were interdependent. These results indicate that processing speed, voluntary response suppression, and working memory mature through late childhood and into adolescence. How brain maturation specific to adolescence may support cognitive maturation is discussed. Mental abilities, including problem solving and reasoning abilities, continue to develop during ado-lescence (Anderson, Anderson,  \& Gartner, 2001; Si-egler, 1978).

	abstract = {The developmental patterns of subcortical brain volumes in males and females observed in previous studies have been inconsistent. To help resolve these discrepancies, we examined developmental trajectories using three independent longitudinal samples of participants in the age-span of 8–22 years (total 216 participants and 467 scans). These datasets, including Pittsburgh ({PIT}; University of Pittsburgh, {USA}), {NeuroCognitive} Development ({NCD}; University of Oslo, Norway), and Orygen Adolescent Development Study ({OADS}; The University of Melbourne, Australia), span three countries and were analyzed together and in parallel using mixed-effects modeling with both generalized additive models and general linear models. For all regions and across all samples, males were found to have signiﬁcantly larger volumes as compared to females, and signiﬁcant sex differences were seen in age trajectories over time. However, direct comparison of sample trajectories and sex differences identiﬁed within samples were not consistent. The trajectories for the amygdala, putamen, and nucleus accumbens were most consistent between the three samples. Our results suggest that even after using similar preprocessing and analytic techniques, additional factors, such as image acquisition or sample composition may contribute to some of the discrepancies in sex speciﬁc patterns in subcortical brain changes across adolescence, and highlight regionspeciﬁc variations in congruency of developmental trajectories.},

Integrative data analysis is an emerging set of methodologies that allows researchers to overcome many of the challenges of single-sample designs through the pooling of data drawn from multiple existing developmental studies. This approach is characterized by a host of advantages, but this also introduces several new complexities that must be addressed prior to broad adoption by developmental researchers. In this article, the authors focus on methods for fitting measurement models and creating scale scores using data drawn from multiple longitudinal studies. The authors present findings from the analysis of repeated measures of internalizing symptomatology that were pooled from three existing developmental studies. The authors describe and demonstrate each step in the analysis and conclude with a discussion of potential limitations and directions for future research.},

We conducted the pooled integrative data analysis ({IDA}) to combine data from four national population-based {NIH} longitudinal cohort studies that collectively cover multiple stages of the life course (Add Health, {MIDUS}, {ACL}, and {HRS}) and estimate mixed-effects models of age trajectories of {BMI} for men and women.

We found higher mean levels of and larger increases in {BMI} with age across more recent birth cohorts as compared with earlier-born cohorts. Black and Hispanic excesses in {BMI} compared with Whites were present early in life and persisted at all ages, and, in the case of Black–White disparities, were of larger magnitude for more recent cohorts. Higher parental and adulthood educational attainment were associated with lower levels of {BMI} at all ages. Women with college-educated parents also experienced less cohort increase in mean {BMI}.

A cohort-sequential latent growth model was employed which modeled alcohol use (use versus non-use) from ages 9 to 16 years, accounting for demographic variables of gender, race, parent marital status, and family economic status. Covariates of alcohol use included parent alcohol use, family alcohol problems, family cohesion, parent supervision, peer deviance, peer alcohol use, and peer encouragement of alcohol use. Results showed that proportions of alcohol users increased steadily from ages 9 to 16 years. Significant covariates were found on the intercept and slope. Being female and higher levels of parent alcohol use were associated with higher initial rates of alcohol use, whereas greater friends’ encouragement of alcohol use was related to lower initial rates of alcohol use (intercept). Alternatively, more peer deviance and friends’ encouragement of alcohol use was related to an increase in alcohol use rates from ages 9 to 16 years (slope), as was being White and from a single-parent family.},

Our regions of interest included the amygdala, hippocampus and corpus striatum including the nucleus accumbens ({NA}), caudate, putamen and globus pallidus ({GP}). Pubertal development was significantly related to structural volume in all six regions in both sexes. Pubertal development and age had both independent and interactive influences on volume for the amygdala, hippocampus and putamen in both sexes, and the caudate in females. There was an interactive puberty-by-age effect on volume for the {NA} and {GP} in both sexes, and the caudate in males.

A popular notion emerging from this work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could explain adolescents’ high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities. These changes in social–affective processing also may confer some adaptive advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one’s intrinsic motivations and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.},

These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control—the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-speciﬁc changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.},

However, the thinning rate, calculated as Δcortical thickness/Δage (mm/year) between scans of each participant, revealed an accelerated cortical thinning during adolescence, which was preceded by less thinning in childhood and followed by decelerated thinning in young adulthood. Males and females showed similarly faster thinning rates during adolescence relative to young adults.

Both full-information maximum likelihood ({FIML}) and multiple imputation ({MI}) were used to handle the missing data.

The 2W-{LCS} model is well suited for the investigation of hypotheses in which changes in a construct are posited as predictors of changes in another construct. In an empirical illustration using data of elderly Hispanics from the Health and Retirement Study, we demonstrate how the 2W-{LCS} model provides the best match to theories rooted in changes, and highlight the advantages of this approach over other modeling alternatives (i.e., Little, Preacher, Selig, \& Card, 2007; Selig \& Preacher, 2009).},

	abstract = {Background
This study explores how mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) develop over time.
New method
this study involves a new application of latent curve models ({LCM}) to examine the development trajectory of a healthy, {MCI}, and {AD} groups on a series of clinical and neural measures. Multiple-group latent curve models were used to compare the parameters of the trajectories across groups.
Results
{LCM} results showed that a linear functional form of growth was adequate for all the clinical and neural measures. Positive and significant differences in initial levels were seen across groups on all of the clinical and neural measures. In all groups, the following measures increased slightly, or considerably, over time: Clinical Dementia Rating, Alzheimer’s disease Cognitive Assessment, and Montreal Assessment Test for Dementia. In contrast, a slight or a greatly decreasing trajectory was observed on the following measures: Fluorodeoxyglucose, Mini-Mental State Exam, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test as well as Hippocampus, Fusiform and Entorhinal Cortex volume measures. However, a constant mean trajectory was seen on Cognition Self Report Memory and languages scores.
Comparision with existing methods
there are no prior studies that applied {LCM} on large {AD} datasets.
Conclusions
cognitive decline occurs in the cognitively normal ({CN}), {MCI}, and {AD} groups but at different rates. Further, some important cognitive, neural, and clinical variables that (a) best differentiate between {CN}, {MCI}, and {AD} as well as (b) differentially change over time in {MCI} and {AD}, which may explain disease progression.},

We show that these 2 concerns are actually addressing the same underlying issue. We discuss diverse modeling methods based on either multilevel regression modeling with the data in long format, or structural equation modeling with the data in wide format, and compare these approaches with simulated data. We extend the multilevel model with random slopes and discuss the consequences of this. Subsequently, we provide guidelines on how to choose between the diverse modeling options. We illustrate the use of these guidelines with an empirical example based on intensive longitudinal data, in which we consider both a time-varying and a time-invariant covariate.},

	abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) to generalized cross-validation ({GCV}) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML}) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs}) use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM}. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly deﬁned functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the ﬁrst such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efﬁcient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} ﬁtting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deﬁciency in the ﬁtted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike’s information criterion and {GCV} are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous {REML}- or {ML}-based approaches for penalized {GLMs} and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

	abstract = {Background: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the {STRengthening} Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R.
Methods: In this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions.
Results: We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results.
Conclusions: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.},

Because numerical integration is often required by maximizing the objective functions, double penalized quasilikelihood is proposed to make approximate inference. Frequentist and Bayesian inferences are compared. A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a uni®ed parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by ®tting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software.

The statistical choices for modeling these effects have implications for both trial planning and interpretation of ﬁndings. Objectives: Three broad approaches for modeling site effects are presented: omitting site from the analysis; modeling site as a ﬁxed effect; and modeling site as a random effect. Both the direct effect of site and the interaction of site and treatment are considered. Methods: The statistical model, and consequences, for each approach are presented along with examples from existing clinical trials. Power analysis calculations provide sample size requirements for adequate statistical power for studies utilizing 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 treatment sites. Results: Results of the power analyses showed that the total sample required falls rapidly as the number of sites increases in the random effect approach. In the ﬁxed effect approach in which the interaction of site and treatment is considered, the required number of participants per site decreases as the number of sites increases. Conclusions: Ignoring site effects is not a viable option in multi-site clinical trials. There are advantages and disadvantages to the ﬁxed effect and random effect approaches to modeling site effects. Scientiﬁc Signiﬁcance: The distinction between efﬁcacy trials and effectiveness trials is rarely sharp. The choice between random effect and ﬁxed effect statistical modeling can provide different beneﬁts depending on the goals of the study.},

However, nearly all previous studies focus on a single class of methods (e.g., only multilevel models, only corrections to sandwich estimators), and the differential performance of various methods that can be implemented to accommodate clustered data with very few clusters is largely unknown, potentially due to the rigid disciplinary preferences. Furthermore, a majority of these studies focus on scenarios with 15 or more clusters and feature unrealistically simple data-generation models with very few predictors. This article, motivated by an applied educational psychology cluster randomized trial, presents a simulation study that simultaneously addresses the extreme small sample and differential performance (estimation bias, Type I error rates, and relative power) of 12 methods to account for clustered data with a model that features a more realistic number of predictors. The motivating data are then modeled with each method, and results are compared. Results show that generalized estimating equations perform poorly; the choice of Bayesian prior distributions affects performance; and fixed effect models perform quite well. Limitations and implications for applications are also discussed.},

However , simulation studies focus on recommendations for best practice, and there is little to no explanation of why traditional maximum likelihood ({ML}) breaks down with smaller samples, what differentiates {REML} from {ML}, or how the Kenward-Roger correction remedies lingering small sample issues. Due to the complexity of these methods, most extant descriptions are highly mathematical and are intended to prove that the methods improve small sample performance as intended. Thus, empirical researchers have documentation that these methods are advantageous but still lack resources to help understand what the methods actually do and why they are needed.

	abstract = {Efﬁcient power calculation methods have previously been suggested for Wald test-based inference in mixed-effects models but the only available alternative for Likelihood ratio test-based hypothesis testing has been to perform computer-intensive multiple simulations and re-estimations. The proposed Monte Carlo Mapped Power ({MCMP}) method is based on the use of the difference in individual objective function values (Δ{iOFV}) derived from a large dataset simulated from a full model and subsequently re-estimated with the full and reduced models. The Δ{iOFV} is sampled and summed (∑Δ{iOFVs}) for each study at each sample size of interest to study, and the percentage of ∑Δ{iOFVs} greater than the signiﬁcance criterion is taken as the power. The power versus sample size relationship established via the {MCMP} method was compared to traditional assessment of model-based power for six different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models and designs. In each case, 1,000 simulated datasets were analysed with the full and reduced models. There was concordance in power between the traditional and {MCMP} methods such that for 90\% power, the difference in required sample size was in most investigated cases less than 10\%. The {MCMP} method was able to provide relevant power information for a representative pharmacometric model at less than 1\% of the run-time of an {SSE}. The suggested {MCMP} method provides a fast and accurate prediction of the power and sample size relationship.},

In this paper, we extend the {GIC} to select linear mixed-effects models that are widely applied in analyzing longitudinal data. The procedure for selecting ﬁxed effects and random effects based on the extended {GIC} is provided. The asymptotic behavior of the extended {GIC} method for selecting ﬁxed effects is studied. We prove that, under mild conditions, the selection procedure is asymptotically loss efﬁcient regardless of the existence of a true model and consistent if a true model exists. A simulation study is carried out to empirically evaluate the performance of the extended {GIC} procedure. The results from the simulation show that if the signal-to-noise ratio is moderate or high, the percentages of choosing the correct ﬁxed effects by the {GIC} procedure are close to one for ﬁnite samples, while the procedure performs relatively poorly when it is used to select random effects.},

	abstract = {When comparing multilevel models ({MLMs}) differing in fixed and/or random effects, researchers have had continuing interest in using R-squared differences to communicate effect size and importance of included terms. However, there has been longstanding confusion regarding which R-squared difference measures should be used for which kind of {MLM} comparisons. Furthermore, several limitations of recent studies on R-squared differences in {MLM} have led to misleading or incomplete recommendations for practice. These limitations include computing measures that are by definition incapable of detecting a particular type of added term, considering only a subset of the broader class of available R-squared difference measures, and incorrectly defining what a given R-squared difference measure quantifies. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate and resolve these issues. To do so, we define a more general set of total, within-cluster, and between-cluster R-squared difference measures than previously considered in {MLM} comparisons and give researchers concrete step-by-step procedures for identifying which measure is relevant to which model comparison. We supply simulated and analytic demonstrations of limitations of previous {MLM} studies on R-squared differences and show how application of our step-by-step procedures and general set of measures overcomes each. Additionally, we provide and illustrate graphical tools and software allowing researchers to automatically compute and visualize our set of measures in an integrated manner. We conclude with recommendations, as well as extensions involving (a) how our framework relates to and can be used to obtain pseudo-R-squareds, and (b) how our framework can accommodate both simultaneous and hierarchical model-building approaches.},

Moreover, within the {SEM} approach it is possible to include measurement models for predictors or outcomes, and to estimate the mediational pathways among predictors explicitly, tasks which are currently difficult with the conventional approach to multilevel modeling. The equivalency of the {SEM} approach with conventional methods for estimating {MLMs} is illustrated using empirical examples, including an example involving both multiple indicator latent factors for the outcomes and a causal chain for the predictors.

Thus, the focus of this article is to illustrate the practical utility of piecewise linear–linear {LGMM} and then to demonstrate how this model could be fit as one of many alternatives—including the more conventional {LGMMs} with functions such as linear and quadratic. To carry out this study, data (N = 214) obtained from a procedural learning task research were used to fit the three alternative {LGMMs}: (a) a two-class {LGMM} using a linear function, (b) a two-class {LGMM} using a quadratic function, and (c) a two-class {LGMM} using a piecewise linear–linear function, where the time of transition from one phase to another (i.e., knot) is not known a priori, and thus is a parameter to be estimated.},

	abstract = {A fundamental goal of longitudinal modeling is to obtain estimates of model parameters that reflect meaningful aspects of change over time. Often, a linear or nonlinear model may be sensible from a theoretical perspective, yet may have parameters that are difficult to interpret in a way that sheds light on substantive hypotheses. Fortunately, such models may be reparameterized to yield more easily interpretable parameters. This article has 3 goals. First, we provide theoretical background and elaboration on Preacher and Hancock’s (2012) 4-step method for reparameterizing growth curve models. Second, we extend this method by providing a user-friendly modification of the structured latent curve model in the third step that enables fitting models that are not estimable with the original method. This modification also allows researchers to specify the mean structure without having to determine which parameters enter nonlinearly and without needing to solve complex matrix expressions. Third, we illustrate how this general reparameterization method allows researchers to treat the average rate of change, half-life, and knot (transition point) as random coefficients; these aspects of change have not before been treated as random coefficients in structural equation modeling. We supply Mplus code for illustrative examples in an online supplement. Our core message is that growth curve models are considerably more flexible than most researchers may suspect. Virtually any parameter can be treated as a random coefficient that varies across individuals. Alternative parameterizations of a given model may yield unique insights that are not available with traditional parameterizations.},

Although it is well conceptualized that activity in the frontoparietal network changes during development, there is surprisingly little consensus about the direction of change. Using a longitudinal design (N=208, 8–27 years, two measurements in two years), we investigated developmental trajectories in frontoparietal activity during feedback learning. Our first aim was to test for linear and nonlinear developmental trajectories in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}), superior parietal cortex ({SPC}), supplementary motor area ({SMA}) and anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}). Second, we tested which factors (task performance, working memory, cortical thickness) explained additional variance in time-related changes in activity besides age. Developmental patterns for activity in {DLPFC} and {SPC} were best characterized by a quadratic age function leveling off/peaking in late adolescence. There was a linear increase in {SMA} and a linear decrease with age in {ACC} activity. In addition to age, task performance explained variance in {DLPFC} and {SPC} activity, whereas cortical thickness explained variance in {SMA} activity. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective of linear and nonlinear developmental changes in the frontoparietal network during feedback learning.},

Participants (8–29 years) participated in a three-wave, accelerated longitudinal study during which they completed a feedback learning task during an {fMRI} scan. Adopting a novel longitudinal modeling approach, we probed the unique and moderated effects of learning, experience, and development simultaneously on behavioral performance and network modularity during the task. We found nonlinear patterns of development for both behavior and brain, and that greater experience supported increased learning and network modularity relative to naïve subjects. We also found changing brain-behavior relationships across adolescent development, where heightened network modularity predicted improved learning, but only following the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. These results present compelling support for an interactive view of experience and development, where changes in the brain impact behavior in context-specific fashion based on developmental goals.},

Despite the prevalence of obesity, few studies have examined how food cravings and the ability to regulate them change throughout development. Here, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining structural brain and behavioral changes associated with regulation of craving across development. In a longitudinal design, individuals ages 6–26 completed two structural scans as well as a behavioral task where they used a cognitive regulatory strategy to decrease the appetitive value of foods. Behaviorally, we found that the ability to regulate craving improved with age. Neurally, improvements in regulatory ability were associated with cortical thinning in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. We also found that models with cortical thickness measurements and age chosen by a lasso-based variable selection method could predict an individual’s regulation behavior better than age and other behavioral factors alone. Additionally, when controlling for age, smaller ventral striatal volumes were associated with higher body mass index and predicted greater increases in weight two years later. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for structural brain changes in supporting the ability to resist cravings for appetitive foods across development.},

	abstract = {The human brain develops rapidly in the first postnatal year, in which rewired functional brain networks could shape later behavioral and cognitive performance. Resting-state functional magnetic resonances imaging (rs-{fMRI}) and complex network analysis have been widely used for characterizing the developmental brain functional connectome. Yet, such studies focusing on the first year of postnatal life are still very limited. Leveraging normally developing longitudinal infant rs-{fMRI} scans from neonate to one year of age, we investigated how brain functional networks develop at a fine temporal scale (every 3 months). Considering challenges in the infant {fMRI}-based network analysis, we developed a novel algorithm to construct the robust, temporally consistent and modular structure augmented group-level network based on which functional modules were detected at each age. Our study reveals that the brain functional network is gradually subdivided into an increasing number of functional modules accompanied by the strengthened intra- and inter-modular connectivities. Based on the developing modules, we found connector hubs (the high-centrality regions connecting different modules) emerging and increasing, while provincial hubs (the high-centrality regions connecting regions in the same module) diminishing. Further region-wise longitudinal analysis validates that different hubs have distinct developmental trajectories of the intra- and inter-modular connections suggesting different types of role transitions in network, such as non-hubs to hubs or provincial hubs to connector hubs et al. All findings indicate that functional segregation and integration are both increased in the first year of postnatal life. The module reorganization and hub transition lead to more efficient brain networks, featuring increasingly segregated modular structure and more connector hubs. This study provides the first comprehensive report of the development of functional brain networks at a 3-month interval throughout the first postnatal year of life, which provides essential information to the future neurodevelopmental and developmental disorder studies.},

	abstract = {Functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) in infants is rapidly growing and providing fundamental insights into the origins of brain functions. Comparing brain development at different ages is particularly powerful, but there are a number of methodological challenges that must be addressed if confounds are to be avoided. With development, brains change in composition in a way that alters their tissue contrast, and in size, shape, and gyrification, requiring careful image processing strategies and age-specific standard templates. The hemodynamic response and other aspects of physiology change with age, requiring careful paradigm design and analysis methods. Infants move more, particularly around the second year of age, and move in a different way to adults. This movement can lead to distortion in {fMRI} images, and requires tailored techniques during acquisition and post-processing. Infants have different sleep patterns, and their sensory periphery is changing macroscopically and in its neural pathways. Finally, once data have been acquired and analyzed, there are important considerations during mapping of brain processes and cognitive functions across age groups. In summary, new methods are critical to the comparison across age groups, and key to maximizing the rate at which infant {fMRI} can provide insight into the fascinating questions about the origin of cognition.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of estimating how different parts of the brain develop and change throughout the lifespan, and how these trajectories are affected by genetic and environmental factors. Estimation of these lifespan trajectories is statistically challenging, since their shapes are typically highly nonlinear, and although true change can only be quantified by longitudinal examinations, as follow-up intervals in neuroimaging studies typically cover less than 10\% of the lifespan, use of cross-sectional information is necessary. Linear mixed models ({LMMs}) and structural equation models ({SEMs}) commonly used in longitudinal analysis rely on assumptions which are typically not met with lifespan data, in particular when the data consist of observations combined from multiple studies. While {LMMs} require a priori specification of a polynomial functional form, {SEMs} do not easily handle data with unstructured time intervals between measurements. Generalized additive mixed models ({GAMMs}) offer an attractive alternative, and in this paper we propose various ways of formulating {GAMMs} for estimation of lifespan trajectories of 12 brain regions, using a large longitudinal dataset and realistic simulation experiments. We show that {GAMMs} are able to more accurately fit lifespan trajectories, distinguish longitudinal and cross-sectional effects, and estimate effects of genetic and environmental exposures. Finally, we discuss and contrast questions related to lifespan research which strictly require repeated measures data and questions which can be answered with a single measurement per participant, and in the latter case, which simplifying assumptions that need to be made. The examples are accompanied with R code, providing a tutorial for researchers interested in using {GAMMs}.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal studies including brain measures acquired through magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) have enabled population models of human brain development, crucial for our understanding of typical development as well as neurodevelopmental disorders. Brain development in the first two decades generally involves early cortical grey matter volume ({CGMV}) increases followed by decreases, and monotonic increases in cerebral white matter volume ({CWMV}). However, inconsistencies regarding the precise developmental trajectories call into question the comparability of samples. This issue can be addressed by conducting a comprehensive study across multiple datasets from diverse populations. Here, we present replicable models for gross structural brain development between childhood and adulthood (ages 8–30years) by repeating analyses in four separate longitudinal samples (391 participants; 852 scans). In addition, we address how accounting for global measures of cranial/brain size affect these developmental trajectories. First, we found evidence for continued development of both intracranial volume ({ICV}) and whole brain volume ({WBV}) through adolescence, albeit following distinct trajectories. Second, our results indicate that {CGMV} is at its highest in childhood, decreasing steadily through the second decade with deceleration in the third decade, while {CWMV} increases until mid-to-late adolescence before decelerating. Importantly, we show that accounting for cranial/brain size affects models of regional brain development, particularly with respect to sex differences. Our results increase confidence in our knowledge of the pattern of brain changes during adolescence, reduce concerns about discrepancies across samples, and suggest some best practices for statistical control of cranial volume and brain size in future studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Many alcohol research questions require methods that take a person-centered approach because the interest is in finding heterogeneous groups of individuals, such as those who are susceptible to alcohol dependence and those who are not. A person-centered focus also is useful with longitudinal data to represent heterogeneity in developmental trajectories. In alcohol, drug, and mental health research the recognition of heterogeneity has led to theories of multiple developmental pathways. Methods: This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person-centered analyses. Methods discussed include latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. These methods are presented in a general latent variable modeling framework that expands traditional latent variable modeling by including not only continuous latent variables but also categorical latent variables. Results: Four examples that use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}) data are presented to illustrate latent class analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. Latent class analysis of antisocial behavior found four classes. Four heavy drinking trajectory classes were found. The relationship between the latent classes and background variables and consequences was studied. Conclusions: Person-centered and variable-centered analyses typically have been seen as different activities that use different types of models and software. This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person-centered analyses. The general framework makes it possible to combine these models and to study new models serving as a stimulus for asking research questions that have both person- and variable-centered aspects.},

This can lead to the overextraction of latent classes and the attribution of substantive meaning to these spurious classes.

As demonstrated here, however, local solutions may still be problematic. Results from an empirical case study and a small Monte Carlo simulation show that failure to thoroughly consider the possible presence of local optima in the estimation of a growth mixture model can sometimes have serious consequences, possibly leading to adoption of an inferior solution that differs in substantively important ways from the actual maximum likelihood solution. Often, the defaults of current software need to be overridden to thoroughly evaluate the parameter space and obtain confidence that the maximum likelihood solution has in fact been obtained.

This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion ({ICs}) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis ({LCA}), a factor mixture model ({FMA}), and a growth mixture models ({GMM}). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the {ICs}, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.},

These models are increasingly important as social behavioral scientists are interested in better understanding change processes across distinctively different phases, such as before and after an intervention. One of the less understood issues related to the use of growth mixture models is how to decide on the optimal number of latent classes. The performance of several traditionally used information criteria for determining the number of classes is examined through a Monte Carlo simulation study in single- and multiphase growth mixture models. For thorough examination, the simulation was carried out in 2 perspectives: the models and the factors. The simulation in terms of the models was carried out to see the overall performance of the information criteria within and across the models, whereas the simulation in terms of the factors was carried out to see the effect of each simulation factor on the performance of the information criteria holding the other factors constant. The findings not only support that sample size adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion would be a good choice under more realistic conditions, such as low class separation, smaller sample size, or missing data, but also increase understanding of the performance of information criteria in single- and multiphase growth mixture models.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine age-related differences in self-reported sleep quality and their associations with health outcomes across four domains: physical health, cognitive health, mental health and neural health.
Setting Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-{CAN}) is a cohort study in East Anglia/England, which collected self-reported health and lifestyle questions as well as a range of objective measures from healthy adults.
Participants 2406 healthy adults (age 18–98) answered questions about their sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ({PSQI})) and measures of physical, cognitive, mental and neural health. A subset of 641 individuals provided measures of brain structure.
Main outcome measures {PSQI} scores of sleep and scores across tests within the four domains of health. Latent class analysis ({LCA}) is used to identify sleep types across the lifespan. Bayesian regressions quantify the presence, and absence, of relationships between sleep quality and health measures.
Results Better self-reported sleep is generally associated with better health outcomes, strongly so for mental health, moderately for cognitive and physical health, but not for sleep quality and neural health. {LCA} identified four sleep types: ‘good sleepers’ (68.1\%, most frequent in middle age), ‘inefficient sleepers’ (14.01\%, most frequent in old age), ‘delayed sleepers’ (9.28\%, most frequent in young adults) and ‘poor sleepers’ (8.5\%, most frequent in old age). There is little evidence for interactions between sleep quality and age on health outcomes. Finally, we observe U-shaped associations between sleep duration and mental health (depression and anxiety) as well as self-reported general health, such that both short and long sleep were associated with poorer outcomes.
Conclusions Lifespan changes in sleep quality are multifaceted and not captured well by summary measures, but instead should be viewed as as partially independent symptoms that vary in prevalence across the lifespan. Better self-reported sleep is associated with better health outcomes, and the strength of these associations differs across health domains. Notably, we do not observe associations between self-reported sleep quality and white matter.},

We explore what happens when data that are not generated from a common factor model are nonetheless modeled as reflecting a common factor. Through a series of hypothetical examples and an empirical reanalysis, we show that when a common factor model is misused, structural parameter estimates that indicate the relations among psychological constructs can be severely biased. Moreover, this bias can arise even when model fit is perfect. In some situations, composite models perform better than common factor models. These demonstrations point to a need for models to be justified on substantive, theoretical bases in addition to statistical ones. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Here, we review a host of studies documenting that specific depressive symptoms like sad mood, insomnia, concentration problems, and suicidal ideation are distinct phenomena that differ from each other in important dimensions such as underlying biology, impact on impairment, and risk factors. Furthermore, specific life events predict increases in particular depression symptoms, and there is evidence for direct causal links among symptoms. We suggest that the pervasive use of sum-scores to estimate depression severity has obfuscated crucial insights and contributed to the lack of progress in key research areas such as identifying biomarkers and more efficacious antidepressants. The analysis of individual symptoms and their causal associations offers a way forward. We offer specific suggestions with practical implications for future research.},

The ﬁrst new effect size index we describe is a residual-based index that quantiﬁes the amount of variance explained in both the mediator and the outcome. The second new effect size index quantiﬁes the indirect effect as the proportion of the maximum possible indirect effect that could have been obtained, given the scales of the variables involved.

We found that tests agree much more frequently than they disagree, but disagreements are more common when an indirect effect exists than when it does not. We recommend the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval as the most trustworthy test if power is of utmost concern, although it can be slightly liberal in some circumstances. Investigators concerned about Type I errors should choose the Monte Carlo confidence interval or the distribution-of-the-product approach, which rarely disagree.

The dataset comprised four measurement occasions (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 4-year follow-ups). With this longitudinal data set, we evaluated level–level, level–change, and change–change relationships between the anatomical and psychometric measures using latent growth curve models. Our analyses indicate that {GM} and {NAWM} decreased significantly over the course of 4 years with annual percent changes of − 0.73\% and − 0.79\%, respectively. {WMH} and {LV} volumes increase with annual percent changes of 7.3\% and 4\%, respectively. Verbal and nonverbal {IQ} measures remained stable in our sample. In addition, we uncovered evidence for level–level and -change associations between several of the brain anatomical measures. With regard to brain-{IQ} associations, we observed a positive level–level association for {GM} and {NAWM}, indicating that participants with larger brain volumes demonstrate higher {IQ} measures. No substantial evidence was identified for level- or change–change associations between any of the brain metrics and the {IQ} measures. Taken together, these results suggest that while healthy older adults demonstrated age-related neuroanatomical decline over a time span of 4 years, these degenerative changes are not necessarily linked to simultaneous cognitive deterioration.},

	title = {A Critique of the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model},
	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/6f85c/},
	abstract = {The random intercept cross-lagged panel model ({RI}-{CLPM}) is an extension of the traditional cross-lagged panel model ({CLPM}) that allows controlling for stable trait factors when estimating cross-lagged effects. It has been argued that the {RI}-{CLPM} more appropriately accounts for trait-like, time-invariant stability of many psychological constructs and that it should be preferred over the {CLPM} when at least three waves of measurement are available. The basic idea of the {RI}-{CLPM} is to decompose longitudinal associations between two constructs into stable between-person associations and temporal within-person dynamics. The present article critically examines the {RI}-{CLPM} from a causal inference perspective. Using formal analysis and simulated data, we show that the {RI}-{CLPM} has limited potential to control for unobserved stable confounder variables when estimating cross-lagged effects. The {CLPM} with additional lag-2 effects sufficiently controls for delayed effects, as long as all relevant covariates are measured. Furthermore, we clarify that, in general, the {RI}-{CLPM} targets a different causal estimand than the {CLPM}. Whereas the cross-lagged effect in the {CLPM} targets the effect of increasing the exposure by one unit, the within-person cross-lagged effect in the {RI}-{CLPM} provides an estimate of the effect of increasing the exposure by one unit around the person mean. We argue that this within-person causal effect is typically less relevant for testing causal hypotheses with longitudinal data because it only captures temporary fluctuations around the individual person means and ignores the potential effects of causes that explain differences between persons.},

	abstract = {In virtually all areas of psychology, the question of whether a particular construct has a prospective effect on another is of fundamental importance. For decades, the cross-lagged panel model ({CLPM}) has been the model of choice for addressing this question. However, {CLPMs} have recently been critiqued, and numerous alternative models have been proposed. Using the association between low self-esteem and depression as a case study, we examined the behavior of seven competing longitudinal models in 10 samples, each with at least four waves of data and sample sizes ranging from 326 to 8,259. The models were compared in terms of convergence, fit statistics, and consistency of parameter estimates. The traditional {CLPM} and the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model ({RI}-{CLPM}) converged in every sample, whereas the other models frequently failed to converge or did not converge properly. The {RI}-{CLPM} exhibited better model fit than the {CLPM}, whereas the {CLPM} produced more consistent cross-lagged effects (both across and within samples) than the {RI}-{CLPM}. We discuss the models from a conceptual perspective, emphasizing that the models test conceptually distinct psychological and developmental processes, and we address the implications of the empirical findings with regard to model selection. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations for researchers interested in testing prospective associations between constructs and suggest using the {CLPM} when focused on between-person effects and the {RI}-{CLPM} when focused on within-person effects.

Intensive longitudinal designs often investigate constructs related to affect or mood and do so with multiple item scales. However, applications of intensive longitudinal methods often rely on simple sums or averages of the administered items rather than considering a proper measurement model. This paper demonstrates how to incorporate measurement models into {DSEM} to (1) provide more rigorous measurement of constructs used in intensive longitudinal studies and (2) assess whether scales are invariant across time and across people, which is not possible when item responses are summed or averaged. We provide an example from an ecological momentary assessment study on self-regulation in adults with binge eating disorder and walkthrough how to fit the model in Mplus and how to interpret the results.},

	abstract = {Temporal instability of affect is a deﬁning characteristic of psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder ({BPD}) and mood cycling disorders. Ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}) enables researchers to directly assess such frequent and extreme ﬂuctuations over time. The authors examined 4 operationalizations of such temporal instability: the within-person variance ({WPV}), the ﬁrst-order autocorrelation, the mean square successive difference ({MSSD}), and the probability of acute change ({PAC}). It is argued that the {MSSD} and {PAC} measures are preferred indices of affective instability because they capture both variability and temporal dependency in a time series. Additionally, the performance of these 2 measures in capturing within- and between-day instability is discussed. To illustrate, the authors present {EMA} data from a study of negative mood in {BPD} and major depressive disorder patients. In this study, {MSSD} and {PAC} captured affective instability better than did {WPV}. Given that {MSSD} and {PAC} are individual difference measures, the authors propose that group differences on these indices be explored using generalized multilevel models. Versions of {MSSD} and {PAC} that adjust for randomly elapsed time interval between assessments are also presented.},

	abstract = {Objective: We examined whether intraindividual variability ({IIV}) across tests of executive functions ({EF}-{IIV}) is elevated in Veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury ({mTBI}) relative to military controls ({MCs}) without a history of {mTBI}. We also explored relationships among {EF}-{IIV}, white matter microstructure, and posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) symptoms. Method: A total of 77 Veterans ({mTBI} = 43, {MCs} = 34) completed neuropsychological testing, diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}), and {PTSD} symptom ratings. {EF}-{IIV} was calculated as the standard deviation across six tests of {EF}, along with an {EF}-Mean composite. {DSI} Studio connectometry analysis identified white matter tracts significantly associated with {EF}-{IIV} according to generalized fractional anisotropy ({GFA}). Results: After adjusting for {EF}-Mean and {PTSD} symptoms, the {mTBI} group showed significantly higher {EF}-{IIV} than {MCs}. Groups did not differ on {EF}-Mean after adjusting for {PTSD} symptoms. Across groups, {PTSD} symptoms significantly negatively correlated with {EF}-Mean, but not with {EF}-{IIV}. {EF}-{IIV} significantly negatively correlated with {GFA} in multiple white matter pathways connecting frontal and more posterior regions. Conclusions: Veterans with {mTBI} demonstrated significantly greater {IIV} across {EF} tests compared to {MCs}, even after adjusting for mean group differences on those measures as well as {PTSD} severity. Findings suggest that, in contrast to analyses that explore effects of mean performance across tests, discrepancy analyses may capture unique variance in neuropsychological performance and more sensitively capture cognitive disruption in Veterans with {mTBI} histories. Importantly, findings show that {EF}-{IIV} is negatively associated with the microstructure of white matter pathways interconnecting cortical regions that mediate executive function and attentional processes.},

A particularly attractive feature of these models is that it is easy to decompose and interpret aspects of change. One particularly ﬂexible model, the dual change score model, has two components of change: a proportional change component that depends on scores at the previous time point, and a constant change component that is additive. We demonstrate through simulation and an empirical example that in a correctly speciﬁed model, the correlation between the proportional change parameter and the mean of the constant change component can approach either −1 or 1, thus complicating interpretation.

Most of our understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of these lifespan adaptations come from magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), including diffusion {MRI} ({dMRI}), which enables visualisation and quantification of brain white matter with unprecedented sensitivity and detail. However, with some notable exceptions, previous studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, limited age ranges, and diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) based on conventional single-shell {dMRI}. In this mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study (mean interval: 15.2 months) including 702 multi-shell {dMRI} datasets, we combined complementary {dMRI} models to investigate age trajectories in healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years (57.12\% women). Using linear mixed effect models and machine learning based brain age prediction, we assessed the age-dependence of diffusion metrics, and compared the age prediction accuracy of six different diffusion models, including diffusion tensor ({DTI}) and kurtosis imaging ({DKI}), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging ({NODDI}), restriction spectrum imaging ({RSI}), spherical mean technique multi-compartment ({SMT}-mc), and white matter tract integrity ({WMTI}). The results showed that the age slopes for conventional {DTI} metrics (fractional anisotropy [{FA}], mean diffusivity [{MD}], axial diffusivity [{AD}], radial diffusivity [{RD}]) were largely consistent with previous research, and that the highest performing advanced {dMRI} models showed comparable age prediction accuracy to conventional {DTI}. Linear mixed effects models and Wilk's theorem analysis showed that the ‘{FA} fine’ metric of the {RSI} model and ‘orientation dispersion’ ({OD}) metric of the {NODDI} model showed the highest sensitivity to age. The results indicate that advanced diffusion models ({DKI}, {NODDI}, {RSI}, {SMT} mc, {WMTI}) provide sensitive measures of age-related microstructural changes of white matter in the brain that complement and extend the contribution of conventional {DTI}.},

It has, however, proven challenging to unravel to what extent pubertal changes may have organizing eﬀects on the brain beyond chronological age, as reported in animal studies. The present longitudinal study aimed to characterize the unique eﬀects of age and puberty on subcortical brain volumes and included three waves of data collection at two-year intervals and 680 T1-weighted {MRI} scans of 271 participants (54\% females) aged between 8 and 29 years old. Generalized additive mixed model procedures were used to assess the eﬀects of age, self-report pubertal status and testosterone level on basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum gray matter volumes. We observed age-related increases in putamen and pallidum volumes, and decreases in accumbens and thalamus volumes, all show larger volumes in boys than girls. Only the cerebellum showed an interaction eﬀect of age by sex, such that males showed prolonged increases in cerebellar volume than females. Next, we showed that changes in self-report puberty status better described developmental change than chronological age for most structures in males, and for caudate, pallidum and hippocampal volumes in females. Furthermore, changes in testosterone level were related to development of pallidum, accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala volumes in males and caudate and hippocampal volumes in females. The modeling approach of the present study allowed us to characterize the complex interactions between chronological age and pubertal maturational changes, and the ﬁndings indicate puberty unique changes in brain structure that are sex speciﬁc.},

Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, {DTI} was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, {DTI} is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved {DW}-{MRI} methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual ﬁber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of {DTI}, we review the physics of {DW}-{MRI}, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results.

However, dimension reduction often ignores relevant a priori knowledge about the structure of the data. For example, it is well established that the brain is highly symmetric. In this paper, we (a) show the adverse consequences of ignoring a priori structure in factor analysis, (b) propose a technique to accommodate structure in {EFA} by using structured residuals ({EFAST}), and (c) apply this technique to three large and varied brain-imaging network datasets, demonstrating the superior ﬁt and interpretability of our approach.

Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

This network contains local hubs, which have many connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have connections diversely distributed across communities2,3. A mechanistic understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the cognitive performance of 476 individuals in 4 distinct tasks. Moreover, there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive performance—individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task. Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbours to be more modular while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities, which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.
Brain networks are characterized by nodes and hubs that determine information flow within and between areas. Bertolero et al. show that task-driven changes to hub and node connectivity increase modularity and improve cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although recent statistical and computational developments allow for the empirical testing of psychological theories in ways not previously possible, one particularly vexing challenge remains: how to optimally model the prospective, reciprocal relations between 2 constructs as they developmentally unfold over time. Several analytic methods currently exist that attempt to model these types of relations, and each approach is successful to varying degrees. However, none provide the unambiguous separation over time of between-person and within-person components of stability and change, components that are often hypothesized to exist in the psychological sciences. Our goal in this article is to propose and demonstrate a novel extension of the multivariate latent curve model to allow for the disaggregation of these effects. Method: We begin with a review of the standard latent curve models and describe how these primarily capture between-person differences in change. We then extend this model to allow for regression structures among the time-specific residuals to capture within-person differences in change. Results: We demonstrate this model using an artificial data set generated to mimic the developmental relation between alcohol use and depressive symptomatology spanning 5 repeated measures. Conclusions: We obtain a specificity of results from the proposed analytic strategy that is not available from other existing methodologies. We conclude with potential limitations of our approach and directions for future research.},

By contrast, visuospatial {WM} performance in children has been typically indexed by response accuracy—a binary measure that provides less information about precision with which items are stored. Here, we aimed at identifying whether and how children’s {WM} performance depends on the spatial precision and its variability over time in real-world contexts. Using smartphones, 110 Grade 3 and Grade 4 students performed a spatial {WM} updating task three times a day in school and at home for four weeks. Measures of spatial precision (i.e., Euclidean distance between presented and reported location) were used for hierarchical modeling to estimate variability of spatial precision across different time scales. Results demonstrated considerable within-person variability in spatial precision across items within trials, from trial to trial and from occasion to occasion within days and from day to day. In particular, item-to-item variability was systematically increased with memory load and lowered with higher grade. Further, children with higher precision variability across items scored lower in measures of fluid intelligence. These findings emphasize the important role of transient changes in spatial precision for the development of {WM}.},

	abstract = {Structural equation models ({SEMs}) are widely used to handle multiequation systems that involve latent variables, multiple indicators, and measurement error. Maximum likelihood ({ML}) and diagonally weighted least squares ({DWLS}) dominate the estimation of {SEMs} with continuous or categorical endogenous variables, respectively. When a model is correctly speciﬁed, {ML} and {DWLS} function well. But, in the face of incorrect structures or nonconvergence, their performance can seriously deteriorate. Model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares ({MIIV}-2SLS) estimates and tests individual equations, is more robust to misspeciﬁcations, and is noniterative, thus avoiding nonconvergence. This article is an overview and tutorial on {MIIV}-2SLS. It reviews the six major steps in using {MIIV}-2SLS: (a) model speciﬁcation; (b) model identiﬁcation; (c) latent to observed (L2O) variable transformation; (d) ﬁnding {MIIVs}; (e) using 2SLS; and (f) tests of overidentiﬁed equations. Each step is illustrated using a running empirical example from Reisenzein’s (1986) randomized experiment on helping behavior. We also explain and illustrate the analytic conditions under which an equation estimated with {MIIV}-2SLS is robust to structural misspeciﬁcations. We include additional sections on {MIIV} approaches using a covariance matrix and mean vector as data input, conducting multilevel {SEM}, analyzing categorical endogenous variables, causal inference, and extensions and applications. Online supplemental material illustrates input code for all examples and simulations using the R package {MIIVsem}.},

	abstract = {Objective: Myelination of the human brain results in roughly quadratic trajectories of myelin content and integrity, reaching a maximum in mid-life and then declining in older age. This trajectory is most evident in vulnerable later myelinating association regions such as frontal lobes and may be the biological substrate for similar trajectories of cognitive processing speed. Speed of movement, such as maximal ﬁnger tapping speed ({FTS}), requires high-frequency action potential ({AP}) bursts and is associated with myelin integrity. We tested the hypothesis that the age-related trajectory of {FTS} is related to brain myelin integrity.
Methods: A sensitive in vivo {MRI} biomarker of myelin integrity (calculated transverse relaxation rates (R2)) of frontal lobe white matter ({FLwm}) was measured in a sample of very healthy males (N = 72) between 23 and 80 years of age. To assess speciﬁcity, R2 of a contrasting early-myelinating region (splenium of the corpus callosum) was also measured.
Results: {FLwm} R2 and {FTS} measures were signiﬁcantly correlated (r = .45, p {\textless} .0001) with no association noted in the early-myelinating region (splenium). Both {FLwm} R2 and {FTS} had signiﬁcantly quadratic lifespan trajectories that were virtually indistinguishable and both reached a peak at 39 years of age and declined with an accelerating trajectory thereafter.
Conclusions: The results suggest that in this very healthy male sample, maximum motor speed requiring high-frequency {AP} burst may depend on brain myelin integrity. To the extent that the {FLwm} changes assessed by R2 contribute to an age-related reduction in {AP} burst frequency, it is possible that other brain functions dependent on {AP} bursts may also be affected. Non-invasive measures of myelin integrity together with testing of basic measures of processing speed may aid in developing and targeting anti-aging treatments to mitigate age-related functional declines. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Cortical disconnection may thus contribute to the declines in some aspects of cognitive functioning observed in healthy aging. Diﬀusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) is ideally suited for the study of cortical disconnection as it provides indices of structural integrity within interconnected neural networks. The current review summarizes results of previous {DTI} aging research with the aim of identifying consistent patterns of age-related diﬀerences in white matter integrity, and of relationships between measures of white matter integrity and behavioral performance as a function of adult age. We outline a number of future directions that will broaden our current understanding of these brain–behavior relationships in aging. Speciﬁcally, future research should aim to (1) investigate multiple models of age–brain–behavior relationships; (2) determine the tract-speciﬁcity versus global eﬀect of aging on white matter integrity; (3) assess the relative contribution of normal variation in white matter integrity versus white matter lesions to age-related diﬀerences in cognition; (4) improve the deﬁnition of speciﬁc aspects of cognitive functioning related to age-related diﬀerences in white matter integrity using information processing tasks; and (5) combine multiple imaging modalities (e.g., resting-state and task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging; {fMRI}) with {DTI} to clarify the role of cerebral white matter integrity in cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of intensive longitudinal research designs to study within-person processes. Examples are studies that use experience sampling data and autoregressive modeling to investigate emotion dynamics and between-person differences therein. Such designs often involve multiple measurements per day and multiple days per person, and it is not clear how this nesting of the data should be accounted for: That is, should such data be considered as two-level data (which is common practice at this point), with occasions nested in persons, or as three-level data with beeps nested in days which are nested in persons. We show that a significance test of the day-level variance in an empty three-level model is not reliable when there is autocorrelation. Furthermore, we show that misspecifying the number of levels can lead to spurious or misleading findings, such as inflated variance or autoregression estimates. Throughout the paper we present instructions and R code for the implementation of the proposed models, which includes a novel three-level {AR}(1) model that estimates moment-to-moment inertia and day-to-day inertia. Based on our simulations we recommend model selection using autoregressive multilevel models in combination with the {AIC}. We illustrate this method using empirical emotion data from two independent samples, and discuss the implications and the relevance of the existence of a day level for the field.},

Using integrateand-ﬁre simulations of an attractor network implementing memory recall and short-term memory, it is shown that all these changes associated with aging reduce the ﬁring rates of the excitatory neurons, which in turn reduce the depth of the basins of attraction, resulting in a much decreased probability in maintaining in short-term memory what has been recalled from the attractor network. This stochastic dynamics approach opens up new ways to understand and potentially treat the effects of normal aging on memory and cognitive functions.},

In this study, we created a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the {DTI} data from 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were performed.

Thus, maturation and senescence compress the structure of intelligence by imposing age-specific constraints upon its constituent processes. Hence, the couplings among different intellectual abilities and cognitive processes are expected to be strong in childhood and old age. Findings from a population-based study of 291 individuals aged 6 to 89 years support these predictions. Furthermore, processing robustness, a frequently overlooked aspect of processing, predicted fluid intelligence beyond processing speed in old age but not in childhood, suggesting that the causes of more compressed functional organization of intelligence differ between maturation and senescence. Research on developmental changes in functional brain circuitry may profit from explicitly recognizing transformations in the organization of intellectual abilities and their underlying cognitive processes across the life span.},

	abstract = {It is well established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the life span. A long-standing hypothesis called "age differentiation" additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date, however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multigroup structural equation models ({SEMs}) and {SEM} trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult life span (18-88 years) in a large (N {\textgreater} 646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.org). After factor analyses of gray matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted {MRI}) and white matter organization (fractional anisotropy from diffusion-weighted {MRI}), we found evidence for the differentiation of gray and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation among fluid intelligence, language, and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern among cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with the reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships among cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (dedifferentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult life span sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change among cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language, and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.},

Cross-sectional research suggests that {IIV} increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. This raises the possibility that {IIV} may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues. Methods: A search of electronic databases Embase, Medline, {PsycINFO}, and Web of Science was completed on May 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of {IIV} in middle-aged or older adults. Results: A total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Nine included longitudinal {IIV} measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline {IIV}. The results suggested {IIV} increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. Greater baseline {IIV} was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality. Conclusions: Increased {IIV} over time is associated with normal ageing. However, further increases in {IIV} over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality. Measures of {IIV} may, therefore, have considerable potential as a supplement to existing clinical assessment to aid identification of individuals at risk of adverse outcomes such as dementia or death.

	abstract = {Background
As greater numbers of us are living longer, it is increasingly important to understand how we can age healthily. Although old age is often stereotyped as a time of declining mental abilities and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience reveals that older adults use neural and cognitive resources flexibly, recruiting novel neural regions and cognitive processes when necessary. Our aim in this project is to understand how age-related changes to neural structure and function interact to support cognitive abilities across the lifespan.

Methods/Design
We are recruiting a population-based cohort of 3000 adults aged 18 and over into Stage 1 of the project, where they complete an interview including health and lifestyle questions, a core cognitive assessment, and a self-completed questionnaire of lifetime experiences and physical activity. Of those interviewed, 700 participants aged 18-87 (100 per age decile) continue to Stage 2 where they undergo cognitive testing and provide measures of brain structure and function. Cognition is assessed across multiple domains including attention and executive control, language, memory, emotion, action control and learning. A subset of 280 adults return for in-depth neurocognitive assessment in Stage 3, using functional neuroimaging experiments across our key cognitive domains., Formal statistical models will be used to examine the changes that occur with healthy ageing, and to evaluate age-related reorganisation in terms of cognitive and neural functions invoked to compensate for overall age-related brain structural decline. Taken together the three stages provide deep phenotyping that will allow us to measure neural activity and flexibility during performance across a number of core cognitive functions. This approach offers hypothesis-driven insights into the relationship between brain and behaviour in healthy ageing that are relevant to the general population.

Discussion
Our study is a unique resource of neuroimaging and cognitive measures relevant to change across the adult lifespan. Because we focus on normal age-related changes, our results may contribute to changing views about the ageing process, lead to targeted interventions, and reveal how normal ageing relates to frail ageing in clinicopathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.},

The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence.

As an extension of this framework, this research study considers a piecewise function for describing segmented change of a latent construct over time where the latent construct is itself measured by multiple indicators gathered at each measurement occasion. The time of transition from one phase to another is not known a priori and thus is a parameter to be estimated. Utility of the model is highlighted in 2 ways. First, a small Monte Carlo simulation is executed to show the ability of the model to recover true (known) growth parameters, including the location of the point of transition (or knot), under different manipulated conditions. Second, an empirical example using longitudinal reading data is fitted via maximum likelihood and results discussed.

The performance of Bayesian estimation was evaluated using simulation studies of longitudinal data with different sample sizes, varying change point values, different levels of Level-1 variances, and univariate versus bivariate outcomes. The numerical results compared the performance of the Bayesian methods with the first-order Taylor expansion method and the adaptive Gaussian quadrature method implemented in {SAS} {PROC} {NLMIXED}. These simulation results showed that the first-order Taylor expansion method and the adaptive Gaussian quadrature method were sensitive to the initial values, making the results somewhat unreliable. In contrast, these simulation results showed that Bayesian estimation was not sensitive to the initial values and the fixed-effects and Level-1 variance parameters can be accurately estimated in all of the conditions. One concern was that the estimates of the Level-2 covariance parameters were found to be biased when the Level-1 variance was large in the bivariate model. However, and in general, the new Bayesian approach to the estimation of turning points in longitudinal data proved to be quite robust and practically useful.},

Within this framework, variation and correlation among the repeated measurements may be partitioned into interindividual variation and intraindividual variation components. The covariance structure of the residuals are, in many applications, consigned to be independent with homogeneous variances, σ2Ini , not because it is believed that intraindividual variation adheres to this structure, but because many software programs that estimate parameters of such models are not well-equipped to handle other, possibly more realistic, patterns. In this article, we describe how the programmatic environment within {SAS} may be utilized to model residual structures for serial correlation and variance heterogeneity.

Here, the search space typically includes all potential relations among variables, meaning that all variables can potentially explain variability in all other variables. Oftentimes, this is unrealistic. For example, weather is unlikely to be predicted by someone’s emotional state, whereas the reverse might be true. Allowing for specification of exogenous variables, or variables that are not predicted within the system, permits more realistic models and allows the researcher to model contextual change processes via the use of moderation variables. We use two sets of daily diary data to demonstrate the capabilities of allowing for the specification of exogenous variables in {GIMME} (Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation), a model search algorithm that allows for models with idiographic, individual-level as well as subgroup- and group-level processes with intensive longitudinal data. First, using data collected from individuals diagnosed with personality disorders, we show results where weather-related and temporal basis variables are specified as exogenous, and reports on affect and behavior are endogenous. Next, we demonstrate the modeling of treatment effects in an intervention study, looking at data from a 6-week meditation workshop in midlife adults. Finally, we use the meditation intervention data to demonstrate modeling moderation effects, where relationships between two endogenous variables are dependent on the current stage of the study for a given participant (i.e., currently attending meditation classes or not). We end by presenting adaptive {LASSO} as a method for probing results obtained from {GIMME}.},

	abstract = {The gain, or difference, score is defined as the
difference between the posttest score and the pretest score for an
individual. Gain scores appear to be a natural measure of growth for
education and the social sciences, but they contain two sources of
measurement error, error in either the pretest or posttest scores, and cannot be considered perfectly reliable. This study assessed the
effect that different combinations of pretest and posttest
reliability coefficients, pretest and posttest standard deviations,
and the correlation between the pretest and posttest scores have on: (1) raw gain score reliability coefficients; (2) residual gain score coefficients; (3) estimated true score reliability coefficients; and
(4) the correlation between pretest scores and raw gain scores.
Simulations indicated that the reliability coefficients of the
pretest and posttest scores determined to a large extent whether raw gain score, residual gain score, and estimated true gain scores were reliable. The study demonstrated that, for standardized tests of
educational research such as those commonly encountered in elementary
and secondary schools, gain scores can be useful indicators of
progress if the user is knowledgeable about the proper type of gain
score to use and its correct interpretation.},

Results showed that ordinal scores and linear gains were highly correlated ({\textasciitilde}.90), and specific conditions were identified such as pre-test score distributions, pre-test variability, and overall test targeting that determine complementarity of ordinal scores and linear scale values for reporting achievement gains. Several properties of ordinal score gains were discussed, including negative correlation between gain and pre-test, unreliability of gains, and usefulness of residualized gains. This report concludes by supporting interchangeability of ordinal scores and objective, linear measures when appraisal of complementarity is supervised by principles of mathematical logic.},

We illustrate the use of {LCS} models with two empirical examples.

	abstract = {An effective technique for data analysis in the social sciences The recent explosion in longitudinal data in the social sciences highlights the need for this timely publication. Latent Curve Models: A Structural Equation Perspective provides an effective technique to analyze latent curve models ({LCMs}). This type of data features random intercepts and slopes that permit each case in a sample to have a different trajectory over time. Furthermore, researchers can include variables to predict the parameters governing these trajectories. The authors synthesize a vast amount of research and findings and, at the same time, provide original results. The book analyzes {LCMs} from the perspective of structural equation models ({SEMs}) with latent variables. While the authors discuss simple regression-based procedures that are useful in the early stages of {LCMs}, most of the presentation uses {SEMs} as a driving tool. This cutting-edge work includes some of the authors' recent work on the autoregressive latent trajectory model, suggests new models for method factors in multiple indicators, discusses repeated latent variable models, and establishes the identification of a variety of {LCMs}. This text has been thoroughly class-tested and makes extensive use of pedagogical tools to aid readers in mastering and applying {LCMs} quickly and easily to their own data sets. Key features include:  Chapter introductions and summaries that provide a quick overview of highlights Empirical examples provided throughout that allow readers to test their newly found knowledge and discover practical applications Conclusions at the end of each chapter that stress the essential points that readers need to understand for advancement to more sophisticated topics Extensive footnoting that points the way to the primary literature for more information on particular topics  With its emphasis on modeling and the use of numerous examples, this is an excellent book for graduate courses in latent trajectory models as well as a supplemental text for courses in structural modeling.

	abstract = {A common challenge in the behavioral sciences is evaluating measurement invariance, or whether the measurement properties of a scale are consistent for individuals from different groups. Measurement invariance fails when differential item functioning ({DIF}) exists, that is, when item responses relate to the latent variable differently across groups. To identify {DIF} in a scale, many data-driven procedures iteratively test for {DIF} one item at a time while assuming other items have no {DIF}. The {DIF}-free items are used to anchor the scale of the latent variable across groups, identifying the model. A major drawback to these iterative testing procedures is that they can fail to select the correct anchor items and identify true {DIF}, particularly when {DIF} is present in many items. We propose an alternative method for selecting anchors and identifying {DIF}. Namely, we use regularization, a machine learning technique that imposes a penalty function during estimation to remove parameters that have little impact on the fit of the model. We focus specifically here on a lasso penalty for group differences in the item parameters within the two-parameter logistic item response theory model. We compare lasso regularization with the more commonly used likelihood ratio test method in a 2-group {DIF} analysis. Simulation and empirical results show that when large amounts of {DIF} are present and sample sizes are large, lasso regularization has far better control of Type I error than the likelihood ratio test method with little decrement in power. This provides strong evidence that lasso regularization is a promising alternative for testing {DIF} and selecting anchors. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	title = {Longitudinal Data Analysis},
	abstract = {Longitudinal data analysis for biomedical and behavioral sciences This innovative book sets forth and describes methods for the analysis of longitudinaldata, emphasizing applications to problems in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Reflecting the growing importance and use of longitudinal data across many areas of research, the text is designed to help users of statistics better analyze and understand this type of data. Much of the material from the book grew out of a course taught by Dr. Hedeker on longitudinal data analysis. The material is, therefore, thoroughly classroom tested and includes a number of features designed to help readers better understand and apply the material. Statistical procedures featured within the text include: * Repeated measures analysis of variance * Multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures * Random-effects regression models ({RRM}) * Covariance-pattern models * Generalized-estimating equations ({GEE}) models * Generalizations of {RRM} and {GEE} for categorical outcomes Practical in their approach, the authors emphasize the applications of the methods, using real-world examples for illustration. Some syntax examples are provided, although the authors do not generally focus on software in this book. Several datasets and computer syntax examples are posted on this title's companion Web site. The authors intend to keep the syntax examples current as new versions of the software programs emerge. This text is designed for both undergraduate and graduate courses in longitudinal data analysis. Instructors can take advantage of overheads and additional course materials available online for adopters. Applied statisticians in biomedicine and the social sciences can also use the book as a convenient reference.},

However, previous research has focused on the reaction to feedback receipt itself, instead of examining how feedback information is integrated into future decisions. In the current study, we examined differential neural sensitivity during risk decisions following positive versus negative feedback in a risk-taking context, and how this differential sensitivity is linked to adolescent risk behavior. Fifty-eight adolescents (ages 13-17 years) completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task ({BART}) during an {fMRI} session and reported on their levels of risk-taking behavior. Results show that reduced medial {PFC} ({mPFC}) response following negative versus positive feedback is associated with fewer reductions in task-based risky decisions following negative feedback, as well as increased self-reported risk-taking behavior. These results suggest that reduced neural integration of negative feedback into during future decisions supports risky behavior, perhaps by discounting negative relative to positive feedback information when making subsequent risky decisions.},

Parents can impact their adolescent child's abilities to regulate their behavior and engagement in risk taking. Since adolescents undergo significant neural change, negative parent-child relationship quality may impede or alter development in prefrontal regions subserving cognitive control. To test this hypothesis, 20 adolescents completed a Go/{NoGo} task during two {fMRI} scans occurring 1year apart. Adolescents reporting greater family conflict and lower family cohesion showed longitudinal increases in risk-taking behavior, which was mediated by longitudinal increases in left {VLPFC} activation during cognitive control. These results underscore the importance of parent-child relationships during early adolescence, and the neural processes by which cognitive control may be derailed and may lead to increased risk taking.},

However, there is a growing interest in the adaptive function of adolescence, with work highlighting the dual nature of adolescence as a period of potential risk and opportunity. We examined how behavioral and neural sensitivity to risk and reward varies as a function of age using the Balloon Analog Risk Task. Seventy-seven children and adolescents (ages 8-17 years) completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task during an {fMRI} session. Results indicate that adolescents show greater learning throughout the task. Furthermore, older participants showed increased neural responses to reward in the {OFC} and ventral striatum, increased activation to risk in the mid-cingulate cortex, as well as increased functional {OFC}-medial {PFC} coupling in both risk and reward contexts. Age-related changes in regional activity and interregional connectivity explain the link between age and increases in flexible learning. These results support the idea that adolescents' sensitivity to risk and reward supports adaptive learning and behavioral approaches for reward acquisition.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Out of the several intrinsic brain networks discovered through resting-state functional analyses in the past decade, the default mode network ({DMN}) has been the subject of intense interest and study. In particular, the {DMN} shows marked suppression during task engagement, and has led to hypothesized roles in internally-directed cognition that need to be down-regulated in order to perform goal-directed behaviors. Previous work has largely focused on univariate deactivation as the mechanism of {DMN} suppression. However, given the transient nature of {DMN} down-regulation during task, an important question arises: Does the {DMN} need to be strongly, or more stably suppressed to promote successful task learning? In order to explore this question, 65 adolescents (Mage = 13.32; 21 females) completed a risky decision-making task during an {fMRI} scan. We tested our primary question by examining individual differences in absolute level of deactivation against the stability of activation across time in predicting levels of feedback learning on the task. To measure stability, we utilized a model-based functional connectivity approach that estimates the stability of activation across time within a region. In line with our hypothesis, the stability of activation in default mode regions predicted task engagement over and above the absolute level of {DMN} deactivation, revealing a new mechanism by which the brain can suppress the influence of brain networks on behavior. These results also highlight the importance of adopting model-based network approaches to understand the functional dynamics of the brain.},

To test this question, fifty-five children and adolescents (ages 8-17 years) completed a social variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task during an {fMRI} session. Adolescents showed decreased tracking of negative social feedback in regions involved in salience-monitoring (e.g. insula) and social processing (e.g., {TPJ}, {pSTS}). Age-related changes in neural processing of risk and social feedback contributed to better performance for older participants.

We examined whether substance use risk factors, including psychopathology (externalizing, internalizing) and family history of substance use disorder, were associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control performance and {BOLD} activation. Among the examined substance use risk factors, only externalizing psychopathology exhibited developmental differences in inhibitory control performance, where higher scores were associated with lower correct response rates (p = .013) and shorter latencies (p {\textless} .001) in early adolescence that normalized by late adolescence.

Self-control was assessed by one measure in {NTR} and {RADAR}-Y, and three measures in {TRAILS}. In each cohort, we evaluated evidence for competing informative hypotheses regarding the development of self-control. Subsequently, we aggregated this evidence over cohorts and measures to arrive at a robust conclusion that was supported by all cohorts and measures. We found robust evidence for the hypothesis that on average self-control increases during adolescence (i.e., maturation) and that individuals with lower initial self-control often experience a steeper increase in self-control (i.e., a pattern of recovery).

	abstract = {Emotional disorders commonly emerge in adolescence, a period characterized by changes in emotion-related processes. Thus, the ability to regulate emotions is crucial for well-being and adaptive social functioning during this period. Concurrently, the brain undergoes large structural and functional changes. We investigated relations between tendencies to use two emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and structural development of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures (specifically amygdala and nucleus accumbens given these structures are frequently associated with emotion regulation). A total of 112 participants (59 females) aged 8-26 were followed for up to 3 times over a 7-year period, providing 272 observations. Participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ({ERQ}), yielding a measure of tendencies to use cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression at the final time point. Linear mixed model analyses were performed to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. Contrary to expectations, volumetric growth of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens was not associated with either emotion regulation strategy. However, frequent use of expressive suppression was linked to greater regionally-specific apparent cortical thinning in both sexes, while tendency to use cognitive reappraisal was associated with greater regionally-specific apparent thinning in females and less thinning in males. Although cognitive reappraisal is traditionally associated with cognitive control regions of the brain, our results suggest it is also associated with regions involved in social cognition and semantics. The continued changes in cortical morphology and their associations with habitual use of different emotion regulation strategies indicate continued plasticity during this period, and represent an opportunity for interventions targeting emotion regulation for adolescents at risk.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Although male brains have consistently reported to be 8-10\% larger than female brains, it remains not well understood whether there are differences between sexes (average or variance) in developmental trajectories. Furthermore, if sex differences in average brain growth or variance are observed, it is unknown whether these sex differences have behavioral relevance. The present longitudinal study aimed to unravel sex effects in cortical brain structure, development, and variance, in relation to the development of educationally relevant cognitive domains and executive functions ({EFs}). This was assessed with three experimental tasks including working memory, reading comprehension, and fluency. In addition, real-life aspects of {EF} were assessed with self- and parent-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function scores. The full data set included 271 participants (54\% female) aged between 8 and 29 years of which three waves were collected at 2-year intervals, resulting in 680 T1-weighted {MRI} scans and behavioral measures. Analyses of average trajectories confirmed general age-related patterns of brain development but did not support the hypothesis of sex differences in brain development trajectories, except for left banks {STS} where boys had a steeper decline in surface area than girls. Also, our brain age prediction model (including 270 brain measures) did not indicate delayed maturation in boys compared with girls. Interestingly, support was found for greater variance in male brains than female brains in both structure and development, consistent with prior cross-sectional studies. Behaviorally, boys performed on average better on a working memory task with a spatial aspect and girls performed better on a reading comprehension task, but there was no relation between brain development and cognitive performance, neither for average brain measures, brain age, or variance measures. Taken together, we confirmed the hypothesis of greater males within-group variance in brain structures compared with females, but these were not related to {EF}. The sex differences observed in {EF} were not related to brain development, possibly suggesting that these are related to experiences and strategies rather than biological development.},

	volume = {80},
	abstract = {At present, there are many studies that collect information on aspects of neurologic and behavioral function (cognition, sensation, movement, emotion), but with little uniformity among the measures used to capture these constructs. Further, available measures are generally expensive, normed on homogenous nondiverse populations, not easily administered, do not cover the lifespan (or have easily linked pediatric and adult counterparts for the purposes of longitudinal comparison), and not based on the current thinking in the neuroscience community. There is also a paucity of measurement tools to gauge normal children in the motor and sensation domain areas, and many of these measures rely heavily on proxy reporting. Investigators have expressed the need for brief assessment tools that could address these issues and be used as a form of “common currency” across diverse study designs and populations. This ability to assess functionality along a common metric and “crosswalk” across measures is essential to the process of being able to pool data, which is often necessary when a large and diverse sample is needed.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery ({CNB}) was designed to measure performance accuracy and speed on specific neurobehavioral domains using tests that were previously validated with functional neuroimaging. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the neuropsychological theory used to construct the {CNB} by confirming the factor structure of the tests composing it. {METHOD}: In a large community sample (N = 9,138; age range 8-21), we performed a correlated-traits confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) and multiple exploratory factor analyses ({EFAs}) on the 12 {CNB} measures of Efficiency (which combine Accuracy and Speed). We then performed {EFAs} of the Accuracy and Speed measures separately. Finally, we performed a confirmatory bifactor analysis of the Efficiency scores. All analyses were performed with Mplus using maximum likelihood estimation. {RESULTS}: {RESULTS} strongly support the a priori theory used to construct the {CNB}, showing that tests designed to measure executive, episodic memory, complex cognition, and social cognition aggregate their loadings within these domains. When Accuracy and Speed were analyzed separately, Accuracy produced 3 reliable factors: executive and complex cognition, episodic memory, and social cognition, while speed produced 2 factors: tests that require fast responses and those where each item requires deliberation. The statistical “Fit” of almost all models described above was acceptable (usually excellent). {CONCLUSIONS}: Based on the analysis from these large-scale data, the {CNB} offers an effective means for measuring the integrity of intended neurocognitive domains in about 1 hour of testing and is thus suitable for large-scale clinical and genomic studies.},

	abstract = {Many large-scale functional connectivity studies have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations during task states. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states primarily reduce correlations among pairs of neurons, likely enhancing their information coding by suppressing shared spontaneous activity. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether co-active brain regions during task states tend to increase or decrease their correlations. We found that variability and correlations primarily decrease across a variety of cortical regions in two highly distinct data sets: non-human primate spiking data and human functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Moreover, this observed variability and correlation reduction was accompanied by an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, suggesting that decreased correlations increased information coding capacity. We further found in both spiking and neural mass computational models that task-evoked activity increased the stability around a stable attractor, globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.},

In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest ({ROI}) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for {BOLD} and perfusion-based {fMRI} time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise {ROI} are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of {CompCor}, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and {BOLD} data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme ({RETROICOR}). For both functional perfusion and {BOLD} data, the application of {CompCor} significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional {BOLD} data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with {CompCor} as compared to {RETROICOR}. In comparison to {RETROICOR}, {CompCor} has the advantage of not requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.},

	abstract = {There is increased need for efficient computerized methods to collect reliable data on a range of cognitive domains that can be linked to specific brain systems. Such need arises in functional neuroimaging studies, where individual differences in cognitive performance are variables of interest or serve as confounds. In genetic studies of complex behavior, which require particularly large samples, such trait measures can serve as endophenotypes. Traditional neuropsychological tests, based on clinical pathological correlations, are protracted, require extensive training in administration and scoring, and leave lengthy paper trails (double-entry for analysis). We present a computerized battery that takes an average of 1h and provides measures of accuracy and speed on 9 neurocognitive domains. They are cognitive neuroscience-based in that they have been linked experimentally to specific brain systems with functional neuroimaging studies. We describe the process of translating tasks used in functional neuroimaging to tests for assessing individual differences. Data are presented on each test with samples ranging from 139 (81 female) to 536 (311 female) of carefully screened healthy individuals ranging in age from 18 to 84. Item consistency was established with acceptable to high Cronbach alpha coefficients. Inter-item correlations were moderate to high within domain and low to nil across domains, indicating construct validity. Initial criterion validity was demonstrated by sensitivity to sex differences and the effects of age, education and parental education. These results encourage the use of this battery in studies needing an efficient assessment of major neurocognitive domains such as multi-site genetic studies and clinical trials.},

We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new {HCP} subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6\% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations.

However, many of the most commonly used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {Low-frequency fluctuations in {fMRI} signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the {BOLD} signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model ({GLM}) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard {fMRI} analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal regression as an initial processing step.},

We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed {RSFC} correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in {RSFC} correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects.},

	volume = {115},
	abstract = {“Functional connectivity” techniques are commonplace tools for studying brain organization. A critical element of these analyses is to distinguish variance due to neurobiological signals from variance due to nonneurobiological signals. Multiecho {fMRI} techniques are a promising means for making such distinctions based on signal decay properties. Here, we report that multiecho {fMRI} techniques enable excellent removal of certain kinds of artifactual variance, namely, spatially focal artifacts due to motion. By removing these artifacts, multiecho techniques reveal frequent, large-amplitude blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) signal changes present across all gray matter that are also linked to motion. These whole-brain {BOLD} signals could reflect widespread neural processes or other processes, such as alterations in blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide ({pCO}2) due to ventilation changes. By acquiring multiecho data while monitoring breathing, we demonstrate that whole-brain {BOLD} signals in the resting state are often caused by changes in breathing that co-occur with head motion. These widespread respiratory {fMRI} signals cannot be isolated from neurobiological signals by multiecho techniques because they occur via the same {BOLD} mechanism. Respiratory signals must therefore be removed by some other technique to isolate neurobiological covariance in {fMRI} time series. Several methods for removing global artifacts are demonstrated and compared, and were found to yield {fMRI} time series essentially free of motion-related influences. These results identify two kinds of motion-associated {fMRI} variance, with different physical mechanisms and spatial profiles, each of which strongly and differentially influences functional connectivity patterns. Distance-dependent patterns in covariance are nearly entirely attributable to non-{BOLD} artifacts.},

These data were compared with resting-state {BOLD} scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation. {RESULTS}: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using \${\textbackslash}leq\$25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity “fingerprints” for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of {BOLD} imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95\% accurate at 10 minutes and 100\% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time. {CONCLUSIONS}: An individual subject and control population converged to reliable different functional connectivity profiles that were task-modulated and could be discriminated with sufficient imaging time.},

	abstract = {Temporal fluctuations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) have been profitably used to study brain activity and connectivity for over two decades. Unfortunately, {fMRI} data also contain structured temporal “noise” from a variety of sources, including subject motion, subject physiology, and the {MRI} equipment. Recently, methods have been developed to automatically and selectively remove spatially specific structured noise from {fMRI} data using spatial Independent Components Analysis ({ICA}) and machine learning classifiers. Spatial {ICA} is particularly effective at removing spatially specific structured noise from high temporal and spatial resolution {fMRI} data of the type acquired by the Human Connectome Project and similar studies. However, spatial {ICA} is mathematically, by design, unable to separate spatially widespread “global” structured noise from {fMRI} data (e.g., blood flow modulations from subject respiration). No methods currently exist to selectively and completely remove global structured noise while retaining the global signal from neural activity. This has left the field in a quandary-to do or not to do global signal regression-given that both choices have substantial downsides. Here we show that temporal {ICA} can selectively segregate and remove global structured noise while retaining global neural signal in both task-based and resting state {fMRI} data. We compare the results before and after temporal {ICA} cleanup to those from global signal regression and show that temporal {ICA} cleanup removes the global positive biases caused by global physiological noise without inducing the network-specific negative biases of global signal regression. We believe that temporal {ICA} cleanup provides a “best of both worlds” solution to the global signal and global noise dilemma and that temporal {ICA} itself unlocks interesting neurobiological insights from {fMRI} data.},

A widely used pre-processing method for reducing the contribution of this component is global signal regression, in which a global mean time series signal is projected out of the {fMRI} time series data prior to the computation of connectivity measures. However, the use of global signal regression is controversial because the method can bias the correlation values to have an approximately zero mean and may in some instances create artifactual negative correlations. In addition, while many studies treat the global signal as a non-neural confound that needs to be removed, evidence from electrophysiological and {fMRI} measures in primates suggests that the global signal may contain significant neural correlates. In this study, we used simultaneously acquired {fMRI} and electroencephalographic ({EEG}) measures of resting-state activity to assess the relation between the {fMRI} global signal and {EEG} measures of vigilance in humans. We found that the amplitude of the global signal (defined as the standard deviation of the global signal) exhibited a significant negative correlation with {EEG} vigilance across subjects studied in the eyes-closed condition. In addition, increases in {EEG} vigilance due to the ingestion of caffeine were significantly associated with both a decrease in global signal amplitude and an increase in the average level of anti-correlation between the default mode network and the task-positive network.},

	abstract = {Most neuroscientific studies have focused on task-evoked activations (activity amplitudes at specific brain locations), providing limited insight into the functional relationships between separate brain locations. Task-state functional connectivity ({FC}) - statistical association between brain activity time series during task performance - moves beyond task-evoked activations by quantifying functional interactions during tasks. However, many task-state {FC} studies do not remove the first-order effect of task-evoked activations prior to estimating task-state {FC}. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous inference “likely active or interacting during the task”, rather than the intended inference “likely interacting during the task”. Utilizing a neural mass computational model, we verified that task-evoked activations substantially and inappropriately inflate task-state {FC} estimates, especially in functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data. Various methods attempting to address this problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected the inflated correlations without reducing effects of interest. Results with empirical {fMRI} data confirmed the model's predictions, revealing activation-induced task-state {FC} inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction ({PPI}) approaches. These results demonstrate that removal of mean task-evoked activations using an approach that flexibly models task-evoked response shape is an important preprocessing step for valid estimation of task-state {FC}.},

Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions and internal states can all markedly affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates.

In the sense that these examples are all special cases of the general linear model it should be possible to implement them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for the analysis of imaging data. The importance of this framework is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude in experimental design and analysis. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The objective of this work is to reliably compute resting state network ({RSN}) topography in single participants. We trained a supervised classifier (multi-layer perceptron; {MLP}) to associate blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) correlation maps corresponding to pre-defined seeds with specific {RSN} identities. Hard classification of maps obtained from a priori seeds was highly reliable across new participants. Interestingly, continuous estimates of {RSN} membership retained substantial residual error. This result is consistent with the view that {RSNs} are hierarchically organized, and therefore not fully separable into spatially independent components. After training on a priori seed-based maps, we propagated voxel-wise correlation maps through the {MLP} to produce estimates of {RSN} membership throughout the brain. The {MLP} generated {RSN} topography estimates in individuals consistent with previous studies, even in brain regions not represented in the training data. This method could be used in future studies to relate {RSN} topography to other measures of functional brain organization (e.g., task-evoked responses, stimulation mapping, and deficits associated with lesions) in individuals. The multi-layer perceptron was directly compared to two alternative voxel classification procedures, specifically, dual regression and linear discriminant analysis; the perceptron generated more spatially specific {RSN} maps than either alternative.},

Highly convergent correlation network estimates can be derived from this parcellation if sufficient data are collected-considerably more than typically acquired. Notably, within-subject correlation variability across sessions exhibited a heterogeneous distribution across the cortex concentrated in visual and somato-motor regions, distinct from the pattern of intersubject variability. Further, although the individual's systems-level organization is broadly similar to the group, it demonstrates distinct topological features. These results provide a foundation for studies of individual differences in cortical organization and function, especially for special or rare individuals. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT}.},

	abstract = {Identifying brain biomarkers of disease risk is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task {fMRI} has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-{fMRI} measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments (N = 1,008) revealed poor overall reliability-mean intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) = .397. Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 common {fMRI} tasks collected by the Human Connectome Project (N = 45) and the Dunedin Study (N = 20) were poor ({ICCs} = .067-.485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that common task-{fMRI} measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or for individual-differences research. We review how this state of affairs came to be and highlight avenues for improving task-{fMRI} reliability.},

We discuss three avenues of research that are overcoming this limitation: (i) the adoption of transdiagnostic research designs, which involve studying and explicitly comparing multiple disorders from distinct diagnostic axes of psychiatry; (ii) dimensional models of psychopathology that map the full spectrum of symptomatology and that cut across traditional disorder boundaries; and (iii) modeling individuals' unique functional connectomes throughout development.

	abstract = {Individual people differ in their ability to reason, solve problems, think abstractly, plan and learn. A reliable measure of this general ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence, because it is the single best predictor of long-term life success. The most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little about function. Here, we ask whether measurements of the activity of the resting brain (resting-state {fMRI}) might also carry information about intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (N = 884 subjects after exclusions), providing a full hour of resting-state {fMRI} per subject; controlled for gender, age and brain volume; and derived a reliable estimate of general intelligence from scores on multiple cognitive tasks. Using a cross-validated predictive framework, we predicted 20\% of the variance in general intelligence in the sampled population from their resting-state connectivity matrices. Interestingly, no single anatomical structure or network was responsible or necessary for this prediction, which instead relied on redundant information distributed across the brain.This article is part of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive abilities'.},

A critical review of previous and present studies showed that no conclusive results could be obtained. Experiments were confined to testing the sensory discrimination of hearing, sight and touch, using the monochord, a graduated series of colored cards, and a graduated series of weights constructed on Galton's cartridge pattern, respectively, for the three conditioned. Five series of experiments were conducted involving varying number of Ss. The results indicated that all branches of intellectual activity possess in common one fundamental function, whereas the remaining or specific elements of the activity seem to be wholly different from that in all the others.

	abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity ({FC}) has helped reveal the intrinsic network organization of the human brain, yet its relevance to cognitive task activations has been unclear. Uncertainty remains despite evidence that resting-state {FC} patterns are highly similar to cognitive task activation patterns. Identifying the distributed processes that shape localized cognitive task activations may help reveal why resting-state {FC} is so strongly related to cognitive task activations. We found that estimating task-evoked activity flow (the spread of activation amplitudes) over resting-state {FC} networks allowed prediction of cognitive task activations in a large-scale neural network model. Applying this insight to empirical functional {MRI} data, we found that cognitive task activations can be predicted in held-out brain regions (and held-out individuals) via estimated activity flow over resting-state {FC} networks. This suggests that task-evoked activity flow over intrinsic networks is a large-scale mechanism explaining the relevance of resting-state {FC} to cognitive task activations.},

Independently, we extract the major covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics.

	title = {Predicting human resting-state functional connectivity from structural connectivity},
	volume = {106},
	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional {MRI} ({fMRI}), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks–including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time–can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using {fMRI}) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

We identified a whole-brain network architecture present across dozens of task states that was highly similar to the resting-state network architecture. The most frequent functional connectivity strengths across tasks closely matched the strengths observed at rest, suggesting this is an “intrinsic,” standard architecture of functional brain organization. Furthermore, a set of small but consistent changes common across tasks suggests the existence of a task-general network architecture distinguishing task states from rest. These results indicate the brain's functional network architecture during task performance is shaped primarily by an intrinsic network architecture that is also present during rest, and secondarily by evoked task-general and task-specific network changes. This establishes a strong relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity-areas of neuroscientific inquiry typically considered separately.},

To better understand the range and central tendencies of network configurations, coupling patterns were explored using functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) across 14 distinct continuously performed task states ranging from passive fixation to increasingly demanding classification tasks. Mean global correlation profiles across the cortex ranged from 0.69 to 0.82 between task states. Network configurations from both passive fixation and classification tasks similarly predicted task coactivation patterns estimated from meta-analysis of the literature. Thus, even across markedly different task states, central tendencies dominate the coupling configurations. Beyond these shared components, distinct task states displayed significant differences in coupling patterns in response to their varied demands. One possibility is that anatomical connectivity provides constraints that act as attractors pulling network configurations towards a limited number of robust states. Reconfigurable coupling modes emerge as significant modifications to a core functional architecture.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic connectivity, measured using resting-state {fMRI}, has emerged as a fundamental tool in the study of the human brain. However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity ({GFC}) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task {fMRI} and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that {GFC} offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, {GFC} displayed higher estimates of heritability than resting-state functional connectivity. We also found that predictions of cognitive ability from {GFC} generalized across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that {GFC} can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of {GFC} rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, {GFC} represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.},
